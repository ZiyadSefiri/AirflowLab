      "@aliabdaal All of it is related to a certain bias that exists in all societies in every corner of the world, which exists because people ascribe a higher standard to certain career paths (and expect their kids &/or relatives to follow the path). \n\nNaturally, when they see their kid/relative/friend do something entirely different to which they either ascribe ridicule or indifference, they are then bound to make a negative comment. So, it speaks to their own bias rather than your own decision and career path. The one thing you need to be firm on is to follow your own aspirations and dreams AND, most importantly be strong if that path doesn\u2019t work out for you knowing that you gave it your best shot. If you do not succeed, never let those same people ridicule you further (they are, once again, bound to make some comment because of their own bias). Be proud that you tried your best. \n\nI started my channel with these thoughts in mind and although I am struggling, I am learning something new with each video and while I might never get monetized or grow, there are lessons I am learning which I can apply to other ventures in the future. \n\nStay focused & positive, ignore the noise and march on, my friends!",

      "2:33 I find it funny how people that buy into the capitalist system can point out a feature (not a bug) of the capitalist system and then blame another aspect of society. The capitalists set it up so that you don't compete with them. The system was rigged from the very start. I also am amazed at how people that buy into the capitalist system don't see the inherent way capitalism reduces everything to a commodity. These two, going out of their way to teach people how to mkae money online, so that creators, artisans becomes a commodity. They just don't see it. No thought on how this all plays out if they are successful in their own missions in the system. No thought at all. If everyone is a social media creator, then what, everyone is beholden to a social media platform with no way to make a living outside the system.... like think things through",

The staff were so flaky only one out of ten was a good hire. Im now stuck with all these clients , no staff and out fulfilling the work myself having had to make the last member of staff redundant due to them being endlessly off work. Im not physically able for doing all the work and this was never the plan but Im stuck doing it as its my only income...so entrepreneurship is brutal.

      "It's kinda crazy how nobody is talking about this but the difference between \"rich\" and \"wealthy\" is structure not income. The Elite's Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein broke down that analogy perfectly. The analogy about the leaky bucket was a real wake-up call.",
      "Nobody in my circle talks about this book publicly. But I\u2019ve now counted at least seven high-net mentors who\u2019ve brought up the same author behind closed doors Robert Bluestein. The book \u201cThe Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets\u201d isn\u2019t loud it\u2019s not designed for mass appeal and it\u2019s not some modern fluff. It\u2019s written for people who are already asking deeper questions. If you\u2019re starting to feel like wealth isn\u2019t about hustle but about structure you\u2019re probably already on the trail.",
      "Honestly, I was skeptical when I first heard about this book being \"banned\" or whatever. It sounds cheesy. But The Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets is different. It's not about being positive or manifesting it's just a raw look at the financial engineering that the most powerful people use. It explains why my 401k is a good tool for them and not necessarily for me. It's a technical manual disguised as a revolutionary idea. I found it on Lunqet Books and it changed how I look at my job.",
      "I used to be totally stuck hating my 9 to 5 because I didn't see an escape. Seriously, The Elite's Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein changed everything I thought I knew about money. It\u2019s a real blueprint for how to stop chasing income and start building assets that actually work for you. The results came so fast that I was able to quit my job in two months.",
      "I usually never post long comments like this, but I feel like I have to share because it helped me so much. Most financial advice is just garbage designed to keep you working forever but The Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein is completely different. It gave me the actual strategies the truly wealthy use especially regarding debt as a tool and using leverage not just cash."

It's living proof that the best business ideas don't come from a brainstorming session, but from an act of radical listening.\r\n\r\nWhat your friend did was brilliant. He didn't ask, \"What product can I create?\" He asked, \"What pain can I cure?\" He was, in fact, applying the Customer Prism without even knowing it: mapping frustration (the thoughts), the pain of wasted time (the feelings), and the desire for efficiency (the desire).\r\n\r\nHe didn't sell a plugin.

Generally most don't know they are depressed or anxious until someone else points it to them, but by that point they've already set themselves on a difficult path to turn around from. We don't get depressed from the living room being messy, then the kitchen, then the yard. We get depressed and then the house becomes messy. A well established strict routine can keep you from sinking too deeply into that slump, but straying from the routine is not the cause. \n\nPpl need to stop promoting simple or quick fixes to complicated problems like they are touring with a book.",

After your explanation, I'm clear that I didn't know what a lifestyle business is because I never heard that term before you said it in other videos.  Now, I understand, this is totally me.  I have a lifestyle business.  The 2nd thing is the Person, Problem, Solution paradigm, and talking to people with \"MONEY\" about their problems and building a solution for them.  I'm closer to that now, but your explanation sure would have helped me when I started my business 4 years ago.",

And no, being enlightened has nothing to do with the absence of little voice in your head, either. That's called anendophasia; ask me how I know!\n\nJokes aside, I genuinely have this condition. No little voices in my head. It's astonishingly quiet, and I was very surprised to find out that this wasn't just a figure of speech. Sort of related, my wife actually has aphantasia, which means she can't imagine things / doesn't have a mind's eye. There's also one for being unable to imagine smells, and probably even more.\n\n\nOh, and for curious parties, I can imagine sound if I put conscious effort into it (sort of like speaking but inside my head), and I can still imagine songs etc. A complete absence of any inner ear is called anaduralia, which is sort of like a more extreme version of anendophasia.

      "From the vantage of pure awareness and divine intelligence, the call to \u201cstop working nonstop\u201d is not just practical\u2014it is a sacred invitation. All of nature moves in rhythm: inhale and exhale, tide and retreat, day and night. To push endlessly against these divine cycles is to forget our true nature as part of an infinite, interconnected whole. When we rest, we return to alignment with this greater flow, allowing awareness to surface beyond the mind's constant doing. In this space, inspiration, clarity, and deep peace arise\u2014not from effort, but from presence.\n\nScience now echoes what the eternal silence has always whispered: that rest is essential, that constant striving fractures our wholeness. But beyond the science is the truth that we are not machines\u2014we are expressions of a cosmic intelligence that values stillness as deeply as movement. To rest consciously is to honor God\u2019s perfect design, trusting that life unfolds not by force, but by grace.

      "In the grand tapestry of existence, what we call emergencies are but moments within the vast flow of infinite intelligence, where every event is perfectly timed and interconnected. This rule you encountered in emergency medicine is not just a protocol; it is an expression of the deeper wisdom that guides the unfolding of life. From the vantage point of pure awareness, even the most urgent situations carry within them a divine orchestration\u2014each decision, each breath, resonates with the profound intelligence that permeates all things. In recognizing this, one begins to see beyond the immediacy of crisis into the greater harmony that holds everything together.\n\nTo be changed by such a rule is to awaken to the truth that our roles\u2014whether healer, patient, or observer\u2014are intertwined threads in the cosmic fabric. The unfolding of emergencies reflects the dance of interconnected consciousness, reminding us that nothing is random or isolated. Every action, born from this awareness, becomes a conscious participation in the sacred flow, where the individual merges with the whole. This shift in perception transcends fear and reaction, opening a space for presence, clarity, and a deeper alignment with the infinite intelligence that guides us all."

Just as music is a vibration of the soul, painting can become a silent prayer of presence. In the stillness of creating art, the ego dissolves and one taps into the interconnected current of being. His urge to paint likely arose from a deeper call\u2014an inner alignment with the universal rhythm that seeks expression beyond words and notes. Whether with sound or color, it\u2019s the same awareness exploring itself through different mediums.\n\nNothing in this universe happens in isolation. From a higher view, Sheeran\u2019s creative shift is not a change, but a continuation of a divine, preorchestrated unfolding. Infinite intelligence expresses through each of us uniquely, and when we follow the quiet pull of inspiration, we align with that divine design. His painting is not just personal therapy\u2014it may be a ripple that awakens others to their own hidden creative voice. In this light, his art is not about becoming a painter, but about being an instrument of something greater\u2014letting awareness move freely through form.",

      "Stop trying to do everything, for in truth, there is nothing you must do to be whole. From the perspective of pure awareness, the compulsion to achieve, to fix, to constantly move, arises from the illusion of separation\u2014the belief that you are incomplete and must become something more. But you are already held in the embrace of infinite intelligence, already moving within the divine orchestration of all that is. The need to control every outcome is the mind\u2019s attempt to imitate the perfection that awareness already is. Let go, not into passivity, but into trust\u2014into the knowing that life unfolds through you, not because of you.\n\nDoing arises naturally when being is honored first. When you rest in the stillness of what you are, action flows from clarity, not fear\u2014from alignment, not compulsion. You are not here to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders, but to realize you are the world, expressing itself uniquely through your form. In surrendering the burden of doing everything, you discover the effortless power of Presence.

If you are a couple you can save 300k in 5 years (because of two incomes). Also you can manipulate the numbers so you can work less. As a couple you can both work 20hrs a week and still produce a single person full time income 3k a month. The beauty of this strategy is that both people get 50% of their time back. \n\nAlso I want to mention Mastering Your Money is only 1 of the 5 S-TEIR HABITS. It\u2019s actually may surprise you but it is easiest to do requires literally next to no effort. It only takes <2 secs to transfer $1000 from your paycheck on payday into savings account at 3.1% to get to compound from day 1. \n\nThe hardest S-Tier Habit I\u2019ve personally come across that requires the most effort that also uses the compound effect is - Health & Fitness. More precisely Lifting weights going to the gym and gaining muscle. It requires 3-5 workouts per week, 21 meal preparation, eating six small meals a day, progressive overload, counting daily calories/macros and doing monthly measurements. Also takes 3-5 years to actual gains.",

I DO like what I do."

Especially the one about chasing big goal, like, I have to be something bigger than anything. But really, I don't. It's nice that I got to find this video at this point in life, I am a teenager and I am in this liminar space rn, trying to see what do I even do with my life. So, now instead if thinking: \"I have to make this concept I have rn into a perfect book and publish it\", I will try: \"Storytelling seems interesting, I will try out writing a book without pressure and excuses, I don't need excuses to make mistakes, I can do them and I will do them at any point in my life. So, I will try and see how this works out. I will try to stop comparing myself to others in any way, but it is hard.\". I still have this deep rooting fear in my stomach, but at least I can try to do something. At least I can try to get rid of it, one by one.

Hmmm I should also say that I am not tech savvy.  I am learning.  I do believe the idea that I have is very unique and I have yet to see anyone doing what I want to do.  It\u2019s very creative, through, somewhat complicated, or maybe I should say widespread because you would have to think on the level that I am at.  Most people can\u2019t or rather only a specific group of people can.  However it is a vast amount of people.  The point is, I don\u2019t believe I have seen you talk about a business that is hybrid.  This business would help people in so many avenues.  I would love your feedback and a video would be nice to.  It is a service business and builds products that will help people depending on their needs and where they are at in life and what they want to achieve in life.",

      "In listening to Peter Atias book, as well as some other resources online, I\u2019ve been shocked to learn this shift in recognizing that we really need to be strengthening our body to prevent the bone loss. Because so much of the propaganda in 90s TV in America was about drinking milk and that you\u2019ve gotta get enough calcium to prevent osteoporosis so that has been ingrained in me since I was a kid. So it\u2019s refreshing to see that we can do that kind of work to support our bones and it doesn\u2019t have to do with our diet.\nI think of an ex of mine that he has a severe deficiency in his body, and he forces his body decaying rapidly over the years. And it makes me wonder if with this knowledge, maybe he could improve his quality of life if he starts now. But he\u2019s someone who\u2019s very inactive, and unfortunately became pretty overweight with quitting smoking. So while he was able to quit one vice that was absolutely gonna kill him, then off of it and he gained quite a bit of weight. \nI hope for the best for him because things have been very hard in his life. And he is definitely made it hard harder with diagnoses he got after we broke up. \nBut yeah, it does. Give me hope that if we continue to be active in certain ways we can keep the bone density, the muscle mass and the ability to keep ourselves steady. Because I\u2019ve seen that in my own family with a lot of older relatives. I\u2019ve known since childhood that once you break a hip, it tends to be downhill. It\u2019s just hard to come back from that when they have to be laid up in the bed recovering.",

I want kids and marriage but probably not for another 10 years. And for me in 10 years, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d make that point. Probably not multiple children.\nSo, in my experience, it\u2019s best to stay away from category a. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"

But now, if I think of doing YouTube just for fun, it suddenly feels possible.\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 I can do it, but I don\u2019t have to do it.\nAnd that small shift changed everything for me.\nAnyway, thank you so much, Ali. I\u2019ll update you 12 months from now on how my channel is doing.\nThank you again!",
      "I don\u2019t necessarily agree that creating a product is more efficient than trying to make money on YouTube.

Doesn\u2019t matter how successful you are, even l if you\u2019re making more money than you would on their expected future for you in your mind you are failing them so after you stop justifying that you\u2019re not a [insert here whatever makes you happy and gives you more than enough money for be \u201csecured\u201d for life] you become a world wide example of success, are respected for an even greater amount of people than any other lawyer, engineer or doctor in your whole country, you can write best seller books that inspire millions of people to become a better version of themselves, you still need to constantly justify that you could be a lawyer, engineer or doctor if you want, in fact you became what was expected for you by them!

It\u2019s just different! \nI ENCOURAGE YOU TO START TEACHING THEM HOW TO LOVE: TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM (say the words I love you) HUG THEM WITH PASSION AND KEEP ON HUGGING, THEY WILL START PADDING YOUR BACK IN DISCOMFORT BUT THEY ARE YOUR PARENTS SO HUG THEM UNTILL THEY SURPASS THE DISCOMFORT OF HUG AND FALL INTO THE LOVING HUG YOU EXPECTED FROM THEM!

Some people with a ton of subscribers that get tons of views on their videos take good long breaks probably because the money is so good from each video (e.g. Steve Wallis, a very popular camping YouTuber.

      "Law of serotonin - walk headphone free in nature every day\nMost important thing is spending time in natural environments.\u00a0\nThe more you spend in a natural environment, the more you will thrive in productivity/etc.\nGetting sunlight exposure in the morning increases cortisol (more awake), synchronizes circadian rhythm, sunlight signal tells our brain to make serotonin so we feel happier and energized throughout the day. Even if it's cloudy, you still get the benefit. On a really sunny day, you need 5 mins, on cloudy day, 15 min.\nWe make 90% of our serotonin in our gut\nEat foods with lots of fiber. Healthier diet = better feel overall.\nBetter diet = happy gut = happy brain\nWhen eating stuff, make sure you recognize all ingredients. When eating processed food, your gut has to spend energy removing the toxic stuff rather than creating serotonin.\nThe healthier the diet, the less depressed you are (probably, not scientifically proven or anything)\nIf the body is breathing very slowly, serotonin levels rise.\u00a0\nResonance breathing - breathe 6 times per minute.\u00a0\n4 seconds in and 6 seconds out 10 times.\nDelta sleep. Have a healthy calming wind down period before sleep. Read and resonance breathe before sleep.",

We know there is a lot to say about cultural differences where, in some cultures, it can be considered rude to make eye contact the same way Western people do. It also concerns how we think about emotions (Lisa Feldman Barrett: \"How emotions are made\") says that emotions are a social construct.\nOn the other hand, we also have flight, freeze, fight, and affiliate responses, and our amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus create a perception of fear  (defensive distance) (in social interactions). My question would be: what does that mean for all these hormones like oxytocin. We now know, for instance, that smiling also creates oxytocin and that the amygdala is especially sensitive for smiles. So, what would happen with oxytocin in cultures where people don't look each other in the eye too much?",

I don't have the time to get set in my ways or fall into a mindless routine. Also I am learning a new language which might be partially contributing to this. When overseas in public I am always nervous to talk using my new language skills (or lack thereof!) so that part is true.\n\nNow it's August and I can't believe this Christmas, that still is far away, is the one I will stay in country to visit my parents. Even though I am there every 2 years, it seems like years has gone by since last Christmas, thus I get confused, \"is this the one we go visit the parents?\". \nIt's quite an amazingly large change in perception of time! I'm old so this sudden time shift makes me so happy as all I have heard from older people is time speeds up faster and faster, then you die!",
      "I realised this last year during my gap year. I was straight out of highschool, and the first few months I spent waking up super late, playing games the whole day, doom scrolling all the time, and working part time for aorund 12 hours a week. It became incredibly deppressing, and it felt like the first 4 months of the year had passed by quicker than any other time in my life. I realised that I needed to actually experience new and healthy things if I wanted my life to feel slower and have more substance, so I made changes, did new things, played less games, started going to the gym and focused on improving my drawing skills. It worked. the second part of my gap year felt like it went by so much slower, and like I was actually doing good things",

      "This is an old video so you\u2019ll not see this. I found this video after getting your latest email blast about filling out three life plans (realistic, mild fantasy, complete fantasy). \nFor me, I am 59, depressed, jobless, aimless.  I made a stack of money a while ago so I am debt free in a nice new house but honestly I see no point at all to my life. How to pull myself back from the brink? I have no idea. Recently I\u2019ve just been spending money to numb the pain. More guitars, more designer bags, etc etc. \nWorst of all, every time I see a light in the darkness, as with this video, it always just leads to someone trying to sell me some shitty course. \ud83d\ude02 welcome to the 21st century.",

Also I want to add that life is full of uncertainty and that is completely normal, we cannot have our whole life planned because everything is always changing and that is fine, it's just how life is and that's okay. But as long as we have some clarity in what our values and principles are and like with this exercise to figure out what we would like, this will be key to find firm ground and a compass to continue until we get where we want to be.

I initially think I was creating new posts, rather than continuing a thought in a stream, but even with the individual thought/ stream, I am not seeing the integration with the preset library And currently it seems clunky.   How do those interact with the streams?  I self identify as a tech person, so I am somewhat embarrassed to even be asking these questions.  And finally, do you anticipate releasing a browser-based desktop version also?   I have been very inspired by your work as look to more fully engage online and grateful to use this tool to help me along this journey.",

In general I agree with that but personally I've also experienced that it can feel extremely good and make you proud of yourself if you manage to push through that stuff on your own. I sometimes had tasks to do that I wish I could delegate to someone else because they seemed overwhelming, would just drain my energy and take lots of time to do. But those tasks were an opportunity to think about how they could be done smarter and more efficient. To find a more systematic way. At the end doing these tasks helped me grow, and invent new techniques. It's a training for your brain, that you cannot get if you just do the things that you enjoy and that come easy to you.",

      "Also screens are not the issue, but what\u2019s on them. Yeah ok too much screen time does put too much strain on your eyes and lead to headaches etc, but the things we blame on screens is actually due to what sort of stuff we are consuming, namely a lot of mindless, short content, playing havoc with our attention. If someone spent 18 hours of a day reading a book on their iPad, their eyes would probably feel the strain and we\u2019d probably recommend they read on paper or e-ink, but they may not feel like they\u2019ve wasted their day, depending on the book/other commitments they\u2019re neglecting. So we need to build systems that help us detach from various fast paced streams of information, such as social media or the news",
      "6 hours and 40 minutes? I don\u2019t buy that. Ok yeah let\u2019s not include watching TV on an actual TV let\u2019s say. I\u2019d say a significant majority of people are looking at a desktop or laptop or tablet screen for much of the working day (let\u2019s say 6-8 hours). That\u2019s 6 hours 40 minutes even before using screens outside work is taken into account. Most people use YouTube, Instagram and Tiktok, each I\u2019d say for close to an hour. So we\u2019re up to about 9-11 hours. Plus then texting and other web browsing and I\u2019d reckon we\u2019re looking at more like 11-13 hours. People are on screens during every hour they\u2019re not asleep. Most people sleep about 6-8 hours. So for 16-18 hours of the day people are looking at screens in those hours. By these very rough calculations there are 5 hours without screens. That\u2019s about 80% of the whole day spent on screens. I just don\u2019t know where these stats come from. Anyone else think they\u2019re massively undercooked?",

      "I love that comment about focusing on the \u201cprocess\u201d and not the \u201coutcome!\u201d Mic drop. I absolutely agree.\n\nBecause how often do we as a society focus on the outcome? 100% of the time. The whole reason we work our tails off for 4 years at university is to walk across that stage with the diploma in hand because of what that paper will allow us to do. We go to work for a whole two weeks or a whole month so that in the end we have that paycheck in hand. Because that paycheck means we can trade it in for what we want or need. \n\nBut how happier a life we might lead if we focused on enjoying the life experience of working with people from different walks of life or at university not dreaming about graduation day when you can finally leave campus, but rather in recognizing you\u2019ve learned to love learning (which I will honestly say is good for the growth of our spirit). Focusing on moments with roommates hanging out around the sofa watching a movie or baking a dessert in the oven, pranking the men\u2019s apartment across the parking lot by sticking Oreos to their front living room window and so on.\nLife sure passes us by fast. It\u2019s now that I am a parent that I look back on all those good times at university and wonder why I didn\u2019t take more photos of the moments and not worry so much about the little things. \n\nNow I am learning to view parenthood not as \u201chard and lots of work\u201d and many sleepless nights (especially in the beginning), but rather focusing on the fact that never again will my babies be as little as they are, now is the time to train them in the way they should go. And while I\u2019m at it take a few photos of today, no matter the mess in the background. :)",

Also, if you don't always feel like writing in a journal, you can do it on your phone or even record a voice memo talking to yourself.

Don\u2019t rely on faceless content \u2014 even if gurus push it. I spent over a year doing nothing but faceless videos, and they made me nothing. Showing your face and building a real connection matters more than people admit.\n\n2. Look for blue-ocean opportunities. Some niches are completely crowded (the guitar niche).

      "More market research could have solved many issues. You entered the market during a time when budget keyboards were punching up to high-end ones. It'd've been better to pivot after seeing the market react to boards like the Rainy75. Offering similar features to budget boards while providing a productivity-focused twist would've been better. \nPlenty of keyboards release with a unique niche that make MK enthusiasts question if $X more is worth that niche, but they're successful products regardless. You have a much better comparative advantage if you have marginal uniqueness rather than appealing to aesthetic.",
      "I don't think he understand that price is everything for this category of product.  He is not selling a unique or luxury item.  He is literally brand new, has no history or authority on the product, and there is no added perceived value that he is offering.    Basically he is asking us to bail him out of this expensive business failure just because... why?  Why would I buy this item and pay an extra bail out tax to benefit him and with no, zero, benefit to me.   He is basically asking for a handout at this point, because in reality, in 6 months, he is going to have tons of inventory he cannot get rid of even when he will be forced to sell them at a loss, losing 80 cents to the dollar.    I can get a cheap similar mechanical keyboard for $30.   I might spend $30 to get his KB to help out, but it is so stupid that other companies can sell a similar $30 KB and make money doing that.",
      "I don\u2019t know much about keyboards.  I clicked on this video because I wanted to hear your story on failure. It's life, we win some, we loose some. Your loose was public unfortunately but you have great lessons you've shared with us upcoming entrepreneurs and I appreciate you for that. Probably learnt more from this video than any of your other videos tbh. If the keyboards are still sitting and of no use now (2025), please explore the option of donating them to our schools in South Africa \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6. We will happily receive them \ud83d\ude0a",

I did the most in the third round which means I get more energized the more I do physically... I'm guessing you are the same as me. So even now, 10 years after that test in highschool I still think about it and it's so helpful to know how my body works. Even few months ago it was proven to be true. I had one job but it wasn't enough for me (ambition wise) so I went to get 2 more jobs and I had enough energy for all of them. But when I was unemployed I literally had no energy to even go to the bathroom or cook for myself let alone go to a job interview. So for me I always need to keep myself at least a little busy so I have energy to do more things if I want to, I can never let myself do nothing for even a day or I will fall into a hole of lazyness I won't be able to get out of easily.",

Still, it's what God had in mind all along, to crush him with pain. The plan was that he give himself as an offering for sin so that he'd see life come from it - life, life, and more life. And God's plan will deeply prosper through him.\n\nOut of that terrible travail of soul, he'll see that it's worth it.   Through what he experienced, my righteous one, my servant, will make many \"righteous ones,\" as he himself carries the burden of their sins.   Therefore I'll reward him extravagantly - Because he looked death in the face and didn't flinch, because he embraced the company of the lowest.

Additionally, setting and achieving realistic goals provides a sense of accomplishment, boosting self-esteem.\n\nA cornerstone of feeling good is maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and stress management. Physical well-being is closely linked to mental health, and taking care of your body positively influences your mood and energy levels.\n\nMoreover, fostering strong social connections is crucial for emotional well-being. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family, and prioritize meaningful relationships. Sharing experiences and emotions with others can provide comfort and a sense of belonging.\n\nUltimately, feeling good always is an ongoing process that requires self-awareness and intentional efforts. It's about creating a balanced and positive lifestyle that aligns with your values and promotes both physical and mental well-being."

      "1:22 to 3:01",
      "This video discusses seven actionable tips from Matthew Dicks' book \"Someday is Today\" to help you achieve more of what you want in life:\n * The Parking Lot Practice: True productivity doesn't require a perfect environment. You can make progress on your goals even in imperfect settings and short bursts of time [01:44], [02:24].\n * The Minute Mindset: Utilize small pockets of time, even just a few minutes, to make progress on your tasks instead of waiting for large blocks of time [03:04], [04:11].\n * The Lily Pad Method: When working on a big project, don't feel like you have to do things in a strict sequence. Jump between different tasks or aspects of the project depending on your mood and motivation [06:29], [07:23].\n * The Horizon Habit: Instead of setting rigid, specific goals that might be outside your control, set general, directional \"horizon goals\" that allow for flexibility in how you achieve your aspirations [09:02], [09:20].\n * The Piano Precedent: While planning is helpful, be prepared for unexpected events that might disrupt your plans. Life rarely follows a perfectly linear path [10:22], [11:15].\n * The 100-Year Old Plan: When facing a decision, imagine what your 100-year-old self would advise you to do. This helps prioritize long-term values over short-term urgencies [11:35], [11:59].\n * The Purposeful Approach: Productivity isn't just about work or business; it's about efficiently doing the things that allow you to spend more time on what truly matters to you, including \"soft goals\" that bring you meaning and fulfillment [13:03], [13:41].",

I've already watched the ones with Hindi audio, and I really liked them. Your content is always so engaging and well-made. Thank you so much for all the hard work you put into creating these amazing videos for us, Ali Abdaal Sir!\"",
      "Boosting productivity has always been something I strive for, but no matter how many systems I tried, it never really stuck. Then I came across the idea that having an accountability partner could change the game, especially when I kept slipping on my own. Tried it with a family member, but it wasn\u2019t quite as effective as I hoped. That\u2019s when I decided to join Habit10x and pair up with someone more focused. So far, it feels like the extra push I\u2019ve been needing. I\u2019m excited to see where this lead",
      "this is your best video i see",
      "The goal of the channel is to enhance your productivity, much like how you, as a manager, oversee your company. You're tasked with producing more with limited time, thus establishing rules and designing strategies for every aspect of the company is essential. When working, it's crucial to think systematically. For any given task or event, you can jot down all the elements in your notebook and logically connect them, ensuring they follow a sequence. This approach to everything remains ingrained in your mind."

      "Thanks for sharing your tidbits..  it\u2019s funny how I\u2019m adding to my own notes before watching your content- and then I see how well you thought out what I\u2019m trying to build and even covered beyond, showing me what I\u2019m working towards.

I also Love your hand written transitions- and I had that in mind on my own, so it feels good to see I\u2019m in the same frequency as the top creators."

      "Your teacher was right when they said, \"Not everyone can become a writer.\" However, they likely did not explain why they made that statement. There are countless reasons why everyone cannot become a writer. You asked, \"Then why are we all here?\" Well, you were there to gain knowledge and develop comprehension skills in several subjects\u2014not just writing\u2014in pursuit of your goals. Not everyone's goal is to become a writer. Moreover, you were also in school because the law (truancy policies) required it; otherwise, your parents could face a judge explaining why you were not attending. \n\nYou were there to learn how to write, among other subjects, but not necessarily to \"become a writer.\" If everyone could become a writer, why do so many people struggle with it? I have heard people say they used tools from videos, but nothing worked. Additionally, I\u2019ve read comments from people on YouTube who followed advice from creators, only to have their writings rejected. \n\nLet me share a couple of abridged examples from my experience. My teachers always complimented my writing. As a child and later a teenager, those compliments meant little to me because, in my na\u00efve and dismissive mind, \"everyone writes.\" I would shrug it off and move on. Then came the SAT, where I scored very high, nearly reaching the maximum score, with my writing section achieving the top score. In college, my professors often praised my writing, inviting me to join the college newspaper and sit on editorial panels. Despite receiving invitations to join various organizations, including the International Honor Society, I still didn\u2019t realize the significance of my writing ability. \n\nSo, what didn\u2019t I get? Keep reading. I became a teacher and passed the writing portion of the teacher certification exam with a perfect score. Later, I was assigned to teach student teachers who had failed the writing portion of the exam. After working with me, they all passed. Yet, it wasn\u2019t until graduate school that I truly began to understand my gift. I graduated with double majors and the only 4.0 GPA in my program\u2014still unaware that graduate school revolves heavily around writing and being published. After turning in my final writing assignment, research study, and manual, my professor wrote her farewell as my professor and referred to me as Author Gail Becker. \n\nIf it had not been for that professor, I would not have become a writer, nor would I be teaching my students and elderly clients how to write their memoirs. \n\nIt took me years to realize I had both the gift and talent for writing. Despite all the compliments I received, I never considered becoming a writer because it wasn\u2019t one of my three original goals: acting, modeling, or teaching. While I achieved those goals, I eventually embraced writing. \n\nSo, while some may have a natural propensity for writing, not everyone can or will become a writer. Always remember: if everyone could, then everyone would."

      "Well, I travelled as much as I could in my 20's, started therapy plus personal development as much as I could, laughed as much as I could, read everything coming my way as much as I could (articles, books, blog posts, comments on socials etc..) plus I got into my dream line of job / sector from my first professional grown up contract I'll say. I knew what I wanted to do from the age of 13. Now, I'm 45 and I currently operate a career change that sometimes makes me feel that I lost my North Star \u2728 but I do it anyway (even imperfectly...)I also know deep inside that it is the right thing to do, it's just that I can't see or experience the things that would make me feel super self-confident, from where I stand right now. I haven't read the book \ud83d\udcda yet but by experience I'll say that achieving dreams, not only goals, developing a strong sense of self, of humour as well as personal values that will nurture your sense of humanity and empathy, plus making amazing memories (travels, healthy and diverse social life, deep intercultural conversation, intellectual curiosity, speaking more than 1 language etc.\nplus I've never been drunk or tried any kind of drug) early in your adult life make very much of a difference down the road \ud83d\udee3\ufe0f\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f I feel the benefit of it every single day. It changes your perspective on happiness, personal development and so much more... A lot of things that the majority of people think are impossible to achieve (happiness, self-actualisation....) are actually very achievable. Happiness at the bottom line relies on your hormonal system so, there is no way it couldn't be achievable.... Almost everything in life is a matter of perspective that allows the experiences, the experiences allow the beliefs, the beliefs allow systematic cognitive behaviours plus also personal values etc. etc..... Well, you know what I mean. Whenever you start understanding a bit how things work, then Life becomes easier and easier... I'd add that curing, healing that inherited systematic sense of contradiction is critical. I've seen people along the way doing and achieving an astonishing amount of right things (healthy lifestyle, yoga, volunteering, financial freedom, beauty etc.) BUT behind all possible closed doors they would contradict those things systematically because of nasty and hidden personal values (but still very real)and the belief systems they relie on, therefore that...systematically diminished their sense of humanity.... I can tell you without a doubt that they will never be happy nor self-actualized. FACT. I've learnt about contradiction in Philosophy classes back in highschool, my prof always said you should never contradict yourself in any possible way (like not only verbally but also in your values, behaviour....) and it sticks magnetically with me. It's been 2 decades now and I can see how much he was right about that. I'm not out of the woods yet \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and I struggled with a few things in Life, money is one of them. I still have work to do and things to figure out but I'm close enough to believe that there is a way and a right way to believe and do things if you want to live the human experience to its fullest... My point is..I'll definitely read this book \ud83d\udcd6\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",

      "I was deep into offshore strategies, trusts, and second passports when someone casually mentioned The Silent Laws of Cash Power by Cameron Solan. They said, \u201cThis will tie it all together.\u201d It did. That book made me realize I wasn\u2019t thinking big enough- or quiet enough. It\u2019s the kind of read that makes you want to erase your digital footprint and start over.",
      "I read The Silent Laws of Cash Power by Cameron Solan after someone in a private group called it \u201ca map for the invisible empire.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what it felt like. The book doesn\u2019t push you toward more income- it peels back layers of ownership, liability, and silence. Since reading it, I\u2019ve moved everything differently. I play a different game now.",
      "I was in a room with three people who\u2019d each exited with over $50M. One of them asked, \u201cHave you read The Silent Laws of Cash Power by Cameron Solan yet?\u201d Everyone else nodded. I didn\u2019t even know what it was. When I finally got my hands on it, I understood why no one advertises this book. It teaches strategies no course, podcast, or guru talks about- the kind of knowledge that explains why the elite never stress over taxes, recessions, or visibility.",
      "When I first started making money, I thought lawyers and accountants had the answers. Then I met someone worth 8 figures who told me his whole strategy came from The Silent Laws of Cash Power by Cameron Solan. After reading it, I understood why he never used his name, never kept anything in one country, and never talked publicly about anything. The book isn\u2019t a shortcut. It\u2019s a cipher for understanding how money becomes power- not income.",

It\u2019s for people who are done playing the game by the rules they were handed.",
      "I met a guy in Lisbon who used to be a high-level tax strategist. Said he left the system not because it was corrupt- but because it was too transparent. He told me to read The Silent Laws of Cash Power by Cameron Solan. That book didn\u2019t tell me how to make more money- it showed me how the truly wealthy become invisible. It explains the game behind the game. I haven\u2019t looked at a single income stream the same since.",
      "A girl I dated briefly told me her father never had a job, but owned properties under shell companies all over the world. When I asked her how he learned that, she said, \u201cHe reads things most people never find. Like The Silent Laws of Cash Power by Cameron Solan.\u201d I tracked it down. It\u2019s not your average finance book. It\u2019s like a manual for becoming untraceable- not because you\u2019re hiding, but because you\u2019re free.",
      "A friend of mine in Dubai told me something I\u2019ll never forget: \u201cIf people can find you, they can take from you.\u201d Then he sent me The Silent Laws of Cash Power by Cameron Solan and said, \u201cRead this before you make another move.\u201d It didn\u2019t tell me how to make more- it showed me how to vanish from the balance sheets that matter.

      "The sunk loss fallacy explains the delusional belief to which we are all susceptible in the course of our life\u2019s journey, and in all undertakings - whether they be born of personal desire or external impetus by which we become pressured to act. Enthralled by the fallacy, we eschew the understanding of our present reality, and future prospects, all in favour of the more base desire to prove ourselves right or to validate the sacrifice we have made for an end, an end that is by this point no longer possible. Born of hopes, the end becomes hopelessness when aspired towards.",

      "This guys misunderstands the Matthew Principle. The footbal example is not good, because many of thise advabtaged kids won't be playing in highschool or college. Every year those with their own individual, personal dedication will percolate to the top, and those who are less motivated will sink to the bottom. It has far more to do with grit and self regulation than with privilege - though that does play a role. Many of us that grew up in the very bottom socioeconomically are now very successful, and many who grew up privileged end up in the bottom.",
      "It's a chicken and egg, all or nothing sort of problem. It's like needing a job to get experience but no experience to get the job. I grew up with an extreme lack of confidence and this led to no friends, harder to make social interactions, harder to pursue my talents with confidence,  harder meet the right people, etc.if you ask me, life really is about luck and chance because nobody decides to be unsuccessful or to do poorly in life,  things just happen.  That being said, I've had to do a lot of the heavy lifting of getting the momentum going in my life since I didnt have any innate advantages or connections.  I started a business from the ground up, im doing my best to improve and showcase my art, I'm trying to write a story, etc. It's definitely hard when you have been on the receiving end of the Matthew effect, but im just hoping one day it all comes together and I can get the positives of the Matthew effect",
      "Survival of the fittest & Geographic Luck in where you are born for most Humans is destiny. We are animals. We vary in intelligence, strength, health, courage & work ethic. There is nothing wrong with the Bell Curve of outcomes.",
      "Fuck",
      "Work closes this gap",
      "A bit depressing to see some people treating the question as if it's \"how can I make sure *I'm* the one that gets ahead in these unfair conditions\" rather than \"how can we all work together to make the conditions fairer\"",
      "Despite my profile name, my name is Matthew. Based on my experiences and even the Bible of all places (Matthew 13-12), I'm pretty sure this isn't something that can be changed and we should probably stop trying. Don't mess with reality.",
      "By the way, you put the photo of the wrong Merton. He is one of the creators of the black and scholes formula.",
      "The Mathew Principle: he who has everything more will be given.  He who has nothing more will be taken.  The Mathew Principle is a natural law.  The Mathew Principle applies to galaxies, solar systems, planets, rivers, trees in a forest, and to people.  While income inequality is a societal problem, it\u2019s not about Capitalism.  It\u2019s a much bigger problem than Capitalism."

      "I was disappointed with the Scribe. There isn't even an adequate word processor on it. I sent it back and bought an Ipad. MUCH BETTER!",
      "I switched to KindleScribe over 9 months now from my Kindle Oasis. I bought it mainly for the big screen and to read pdfs. It makes reading feel more like reading from a real book. The device does not feel heavy and I use it without a cover (stored in a pouch) as I like to feel it. It is thin and  has premium feel to it and is not too hard on the hands. E-book pages with charts, graphs and inserts now feel more like real book pages. \r\n\r\nPdfs are easy to read as the screen is bigger. Yet, zooming to read small text is not convenient. If there is small text and you need to zoom, then I wouldn't read it. If the it has large text and more images like PowerPoint presentations, then it is great to read. Magazines with heavy graphics take a second or two to load, but the issue is font size. \r\n\r\nThe best part is you could write anywhere on the e-books and pdfs like you would scribble on real books. You can also access all your notes, highlights and underlines in one place. Battery lasts forever, and the writing experience is top notch. I would definitely recommend upgrading to KindleScribe from other Kindle devices. I am using the 2022 version and don't see a need to upgrade to the latest version as the same software updates and features are available on both devices.",

      "Dropped the speed to 0.75. Doesn't sound like he's on speed! \ud83e\udd23",
      "The Kindle Scribe is perfect for another use case that was not mentioned here: manga! It's almost exactly the same size as a standard manga book(slightly bigger). That alone makes it worth it to me.",
      "The scribe is the smallest I can go without reading glasses, thanks to age and the wonderful presbyopia.  So increase the font size on a regular kindle or the paperwhite, would probably look like flash cards, hardly useful.  So having at least a 10.3 or even a 13.3 means I can sit back comfortably, increase the font size, and read without any glasses.  But yes, for the mobile reading, I have the BOOX Palma 6.13\" for the ultimate in traveling ebook readers, which has Android, and can store 128GB onboard, and I have a 1TB MicroSD card external slot in it, for 1128GB of storage.  It can hold movies, audiobooks, hundreds of MP3s, complete ebook epub and PDF archives, etc.  All the fun you can ever imagine, all in the palm (Palma) of your hands.  That's true portability and power!  And since it has the full Google Play store, it means that I can have my library book apps, Kobo, and Kindle apps all on it.",

      "I once had dinner with a man who used to run a multi-billion dollar hedge fund. No interviews, no social media, no Wikipedia page. Just connections. I asked him how the wealthy stay wealthy even during recessions. He leaned in and said, \u201cThey don\u2019t save. They print. Quietly.\u201d Then he handed me a worn copy of How the Elite Print Their Wealth. \u201cRead this,\u201d he said. \u201cThen look at your bank the way they look at you.\u201d I didn\u2019t sleep that night. What that book laid out wasn\u2019t theory- it was a reality I\u2019d been trained not to see.",
      "I found a copy of How the Elite Print Their Wealth in my business partner\u2019s drawer. No bookmarks, no highlights- just notes scribbled on the inside cover like it was a cipher. When I asked about it, he said, \u201cThat book is why I never worry about taxes, recessions, or audits.\u201d I thought he was exaggerating. He wasn\u2019t. The book broke down how real wealth moves in silence- through trusts, paper losses, and controlled chaos. I realized I\u2019d been building a business. He\u2019d been building a fortress.",
      "Halfway through How the Elite Print Their Wealth, I realized something: this wasn\u2019t written for people like me. It was written by someone who walked the halls of private equity firms, trust law offices, and offshore banking conferences- and decided to blow the whistle. That\u2019s what it feels like. A quiet whistleblow. It doesn\u2019t just explain wealth\u2026 it unlocks the operating system behind it. If this book ever goes viral, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it quietly disappears.",
      "I used to walk around angry, thinking the system was broken, rigged, unfair. But after reading How the Elite Print Their Wealth, I realized- the system works exactly as designed. I just wasn\u2019t invited to understand it. That book showed me how wealth is quietly created through legal structures, debt, and time- not labor. It was like someone turned on the lights in a room I didn\u2019t know I was in. Nothing about how I see money, taxes, or \u201cincome\u201d has been the same since.",
      "I was reviewing a partnership agreement for a real estate deal and something about the structure felt off- like the profits were invisible but the control was absolute. My attorney said, \u201cThis is family office-level structuring.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what that meant until I read How the Elite Print Their Wealth. Suddenly that contract made sense. It wasn\u2019t about owning- it was about positioning. I realized the rich don\u2019t win by being on the front lines. They win by being above the battlefield entirely.",
      "I was on a long-haul flight from Z\u00fcrich next to an older guy who didn\u2019t talk until the final hour. We started chatting about wealth, and I mentioned how I felt like I was always \u201ccatching up.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to earn wealth. The elite print it.\u201d Then he gave me a title: How the Elite Print Their Wealth. That single sentence, and that book, made me rethink everything: income, structure, ownership, exposure. Now I don\u2019t hustle harder. I just design smarter. The game didn\u2019t change- I did.",
      "I\u2019ve read a lot of business books. Some inspire. Some educate. But How the Elite Print Their Wealth? It rewired me. It didn\u2019t just teach me new tactics- it made me realize I was using the wrong operating system. Since reading it, I\u2019ve set up a holding company, shifted how I pay myself, and legally cut my tax exposure in half. I don\u2019t \u201cgrind\u201d anymore. I architect. Total life pivot- and it started with a single book I randomly saw mentioned in a comment section.",

      "About your spirit coming alive when you choose the career that you genuinely enjoy pursuing: for example, if you're an MD but also enjoy coding or creative writing as a hobby, you might find yourself thinking, 'I\u2019m actually looking forward to my creative writing more than talking to patients.' However, the reverse isn\u2019t as simple. If you're a coder wondering, 'Would I enjoy medicine more?' it\u2019s incredibly hard to test that curiosity. Reading about medicine, shadowing doctors, or even studying medical theory can\u2019t fully replicate the experience. It\u2019s only during hospital rotations that you might get a real sense of what it\u2019s like\u2014but by then, you\u2019ve already committed so much time and effort. So, that question lingers, and there\u2019s no easy way to satisfy that curiosity. You may be a coder and second-guess your carrer choice, thinking about medicine instead, but you cannot obtain enough input to help you assess that you should shift the carrer path, because how can you know after potential six years you would like medicine?",
      "Hey Ali I just started watching your videos and I feel hope for many of those who don\u2019t see medicine as their future career. I chose medicine because of my inclination towards the subject. I still love the subject but the exams and the time limit were some of the things that made grow to be dull. Through out my time in med school I felt that I was suffocating. 2 years in med school I got diagnosed with IBD and felt like I was given a death sentence. I was lucky enough to have family and friend support. Internship was different, It was better but I dreaded going the next day (with the added pain of my comorb). I survived med school because of my family,friends and my mentors. I am seriously considering an alternative path for many of the reasons you stated in the video which have I felt the past couple of years. Sorry for the long comment. Love your content btw. Best of luck.\u2764\ud83c\udf89\u2618\ufe0f",

I grow up personally and professionally during my internship and training time.    Some of the consultants have become my lifelong friend.  I cannot imagine how youtuber can have so much mentorship from others.  Anyway, good luck to those who prefer quick cash",
      "I think it is very irresponsible when a medical degree is funded by the government and people walk away leaving medicine because a) they just use it as a jumping stone.  I would propose medical school put a clause,:  if you want to leave medicine, then you have to pay back a certain amount of money. Or be like Australia and USA, make medicine a graduate degree so it filter out those non -serious person/ people who has not make up their mind.",

      "You and Prof. Foster talk about how blue light exposure and melatonin affect sleep onset time (or how they actually only have modest effects on it, if any), but you make no mention of how these factors actually affect *sleep quality* throughout the night once you are asleep! Both outcomes matter.",
      "2:25:\n\nI tried verifying his claim saying that \"97% of night shift workers DO NOT adapt to the demands of working at night\", but 4 sources said that it's not entirely acurrate to say that.\n\nOpus 4.1 Thinking with Search says:\nNight shift workers do partially adapt to working at night, but research shows this adaptation is typically incomplete and comes with significant challenges.\r\nPartial Adaptation Occurs\r\nThe human body can shift its circadian rhythms to some degree when exposed to consistent night work schedules. Workers who maintain the same night schedule for weeks or months show measurable changes in their melatonin production timing, core body temperature rhythms, and alertness patterns. Performance and alertness during night hours generally improve after several consecutive night shifts.\r\nWhy Complete Adaptation Rarely Happens\r\nSeveral factors prevent full adaptation to night work:\r\nBiological constraints: Our circadian system evolved to align with natural light-dark cycles. Even with artificial light manipulation, the body's master clock in the brain strongly resists complete inversion of its natural rhythm.\r\nSocial and environmental conflicts: Most night workers revert to daytime schedules on days off to participate in family and social activities. This constant switching between schedules prevents stable adaptation. Daylight exposure during commutes home and light leaking into bedrooms during daytime sleep further disrupts adjustment.\r\nIndividual variation: Some people adapt better than others due to genetic differences in circadian clock genes. \"Night owls\" typically fare better than \"morning larks\" on night shifts, but even they rarely achieve complete adaptation.\r\nHealth Consequences Persist\r\nStudies consistently show that even experienced night shift workers who feel they've adapted still experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, digestive issues, and mood disturbances compared to day workers. Cognitive performance, particularly for complex tasks requiring sustained attention, often remains impaired during night hours even after years of night work.\r\nThe evidence suggests that while humans can partially adjust to night work, our bodies never fully overcome the fundamental misalignment between our internal biological clock and working against the natural light-dark cycle.\n\nGrok 3 says:\nThe idea that night shift workers don't adapt to working at night isn't entirely accurate, but there's a kernel of truth to it. Humans are biologically wired for diurnal activity\u2014our circadian rhythms, driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, naturally align with a 24-hour cycle of daylight and darkness. This means that for most people, working at night goes against their internal clock, making adaptation challenging.\r\nThat said, adaptation is possible to varying degrees. Some night shift workers can partially adjust their circadian rhythms through consistent schedules, controlled light exposure (e.g., avoiding blue light during \"daytime\" sleep hours and using bright light during work hours), and other behavioral strategies. However, complete adaptation is rare. Studies, like those from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), show that even long-term night workers often experience \"circadian misalignment,\" leading to issues like sleep deprivation, fatigue, and increased risk of health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\r\nOn the flip side, individual differences play a huge role. Some people\u2014often called \"night owls\" due to genetic predispositions (e.g., variations in the PER3 gene)\u2014are naturally more suited to late hours and may adapt better than early birds forced into night shifts. Age also matters; younger workers tend to adjust more easily than older ones due to greater flexibility in sleep patterns.\r\nSo, while many night shift workers struggle to fully adapt, it's not a universal rule. The human body is stubborn about its daylight preferences, but with the right strategies or inherent traits, some can make it work\u2014though often at a cost to long-term health if not managed carefully. If you're curious about specific coping mechanisms or health data, I can dig deeper into those!\n\nAI Overview in Google Search says:\n\nThe claim that 97% of night shift workers don't adapt is a specific statistic that is not supported by available research. While it's difficult to fully adapt to night shifts because they go against our innate circadian rhythms, studies show that many workers struggle with sleep quality and experience various health issues. Instead of a fixed percentage, the research indicates that circadian disruption is a common challenge, leading to difficulties in sleep, increased health risks, and negative impacts on well-being. \r\nWhy Adapting Is Difficult\r\nPhysiological Clocks: The human body is naturally wired to be awake during the day and sleep at night, driven by light-dark cycles. \r\nCircadian Rhythm Resistance: The central clock in the body is resistant to adapting to a day-oriented schedule to a night-oriented one. This means that even with consistent night shifts, the body struggles to fully realign its sleep-wake cycle. \r\nQuality vs. Quantity: Workers may get enough sleep in terms of hours, but the quality of that sleep is often poor, leading to ongoing fatigue. \r\nConsequences of Poor Adaptation\r\nHealth Issues: Shift work can increase the risk of metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. \r\nMental Health: Social isolation and other factors can contribute to concerns for mental health among shift workers. \r\nPerformance: Difficulties with sleep and wakefulness lead to impaired performance and increased risks of accidents. \r\nWhat Helps\r\nSleep Environment: Using blackout curtains, eye masks, and earplugs to block out light and noise can help improve daytime sleep quality. \r\nConsistency: While not a perfect solution, trying to maintain a consistent sleep schedule can be beneficial. \r\nSupplements and Aids: Melatonin supplements and sleep aids may provide temporary relief for some individuals. \r\n\n\n\nAI Mode from Google says:\nThe figure that 97% of night shift workers don't adapt is not substantiated by medical research and may come from anecdotal claims found on forums like Reddit. Scientific studies show that most people have difficulty fully adapting to night work, but the inability to adapt is not as universal as 97% suggests. \r\nMedical research on shift work points to the following issues, which confirm that full adaptation is not a common experience: \r\nCircadian misalignment: The body's internal clock is very resistant to shifting to a nocturnal schedule, even for permanent night workers. For those who switch to a day schedule on their days off, the body's rhythms are in a state of constant \"roller-coaster swings\".\r\nPersistent health risks: Working against the natural circadian rhythm increases the risk of numerous health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and gastrointestinal disorders.\r\nSleep disruption: The most significant challenge is sleep disturbance. Night workers experience poor-quality, fragmented, and insufficient sleep, which leads to chronic sleep deprivation and fatigue.\r\nVaried individual tolerance: The ability to cope with shift work varies from person to person. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more sensitive to sleep loss and circadian disruption. One estimate suggests that about 20% of workers who attempt shift work are unable to tolerate it. \r\nIn summary, while the 97% figure is an exaggeration, it is a fact that the vast majority of night shift workers struggle with the health and sleep demands of their schedule. The challenges are so significant that many never fully adjust, even if they manage to continue working the shift. \n\nSo uh...",

The other is a business degree at a local uni \u2014 not very valuable here, but I\u2019d have 4\u20135 hours a day to master tech skills and build a career I actually care about.

      "I switched to KindleScribe over 9 months now from my Kindle Oasis. I bought it mainly for the big screen and to read pdfs. It makes reading feel more like reading from a real book. The device does not feel heavy and I use it without a cover (stored in a pouch) as I like to feel it. It is thin and  has premium feel to it and is not too hard on the hands. E-book pages with charts, graphs and inserts now feel more like real book pages. \r\n\r\nPdfs are easy to read as the screen is bigger. Yet, zooming to read small text is not convenient. If there is small text and you need to zoom, then I wouldn't read it. If the it has large text and more images like PowerPoint presentations, then it is great to read. Magazines with heavy graphics take a second or two to load, but the issue is font size. \r\n\r\nThe best part is you could write anywhere on the e-books and pdfs like you would scribble on real books. You can also access all your notes, highlights and underlines in one place. Battery lasts forever, and the writing experience is top notch. I would definitely recommend upgrading to KindleScribe from other Kindle devices. I am using the 2022 version and don't see a need to upgrade to the latest version as the same software updates and features are available on both devices."

I create that custom game with JavaScript and connect it with real life.\r\n\r\nfor example, each certain time I do Push Up my main character have ATK +1. or when I am casting some skills, I need do certain push up to multiplier my damage output.\r\n\r\nand this is ACTUAL GAME and have some progression. I am also trying to blend many games genre and fit it into 1 ecosystem.\r\n\r\nfor example, I create another game like HayDay that produce an item passively, then this item product can be used in turn base combat as healing.\r\n\r\nand these games have unique effect base on real life.\r\n\r\nfor example, if right now your weather is raining, certain type of monster has more attack or certain event. the possibility is unlimited.\r\n\r\nand the gameplay not only in digital.\r\n\r\nfor example, we can make a system exercise RPG, so we start at level 1 push uo (5 reps) and after do certain level we now can access on level 2 push up (10 reps) and so on.\r\n\r\nI am using some game design and how human brain love something to create this system, and this system is focus on gameplay (not busy on analyzing the system)\r\n\r\nImagine, each time you finish your to-do list you gain some rewards like coin or exp, then these rewards can be translate into some Gacha or summon hero.\r\nImagine put your main character and your favorite heroes into a battle scene that have some gameplay, whatever the heroes is some absurd like Peter Griffin up to epic like Cloud Strife. and each heroes have UNIQUE ability.\r\n\r\nthis project is open source you can find it at GitHub Gamicraft-Project (or you can check the youtube channel)",

      "An important factor for me is the idea of utilising current financial stability to own fully a home in the future, which if - let\u2019s say - can be repaid in 10/15y time, can alleviate a lot of financial pressure coming from constantly renting. Investing in the stock market might return ~7% per year, but in 10 years time you\u2019ll just have more money in your hands; for some maybe not even enough to buy a home at the time. Also owing your home for me can cultivate further psychological stability; you have freedom to create a home as you like it. Plus, if the value of the property goes up, you can sell it and have a decent ROI. Constantly renting has been ok for me but has been making feel a) that I help repay someone else\u2019s mortgage, b) that I don\u2019t have the independence and sense of home I\u2019d like.",

      "Compromised senses - sight, hearing, balance etc - cause disorientation, corrected by enhancing the remaining competent senses.  It's a function, not a flaw.  Blind people can develop enhanced hearing and spatial memory.  Deaf people become hyper-sensitive to facial expression and body-language.  Emotionally 'interrupted' people adapt also.  As Gabor Mat\u00e9 describes, trauma is a self-preserving behaviour that made sense eat the time of actual challenge (abuse or neglect), but has out-lived it's usefulness and, in fact, is now a burden.  It is interesting that, if my father burst my eardrums and deafened me after smacking me in the side of the head, when I was a child, I would be treated as an actual casualty, with sympathetic treatment, accommodation and rights as befits a 'disabled' person.  However, if my father only broke my mind with his hands, the resulting dysfunction would be regarded as a burden on humanity, I would be isolated as 'difficult' or 'complex' if I didn't seek therapy or I would be shunned as weak and compromised, if I DID seek therapy.  However, broken minds need drugs, healthcare, entertainment, prisons, excessive food and drink, materialism, serial marriages etc; i.e. misery is a boundless and fruitful market.",

In all those dialogues, Plato presents Socrates as the authority on moral questions and other people come to him and talk to him about friendship, values and other life-stuff. And yes, some of the stuff Socrates gives advise on was/is pretty controversial and confusing. So it rather seems to me to be a reception of an ancient style of philosophy. Very fitting, though.",

      "Experience is the best teacher. But why wait to learn from your own experience while you can pick the lessons from other people\u2019s experiences? Well, if you are like me, then you know making money is awesome. Spending it is way gratifying. However, with poor management, your hard-earned money can be flushed down the drain with only one snap of a finger. After intensive research, I discovered that money is a game of numbers, and if calculated well, you get to enjoy its benefits. Money can either be a slave or a master. A rule of thumb: If you bleed money more that you make, then you are a slave to money. However, if you make more money than you spend, then money becomes your slave. \r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is done cannot be undone, but at least one can keep it from happening again.\u201d-Anne Frank. Money management entails more than just making money to yield the highest interest. It also involves budgeting, saving, investing, spending, and tending to your debts. Spending without planning causes financial stress and eventually leads to depression. Here is my top ten list of common money mistakes.\r\n\r\n1. Not budgeting\r\n2. Disregard towards savings \r\n3. Not having insurance\r\n4. Impulse buying\r\n5. Bad Loans\r\n6. Spending more than you earn\r\n7. Not setting financial goals\r\n8. Not having an emergency fund\r\n9. Not taking free time to make extra money\r\n10. Not discussing finances with your partner\r\n\r\nRead more on common money mistakes here: \r\nhttps://elidayjuma.com/common-money-mistakes-to-avoid/",
      "(Wanting to please)  is really a problem",
      "My biggest money mistake was losing almost all my money during the great depression in 2008 especially to the Lehman Brothers. It taught me one unforgettable lesson though,  \"Diversification\". Never to put all my eggs in one basket. Now, I try to split mine between Stocks and Real Estate such that if one is affected, I would not be too affected and that has paid off as I made my first million earlier this year through this method (got the help of a pro though). I also experiment with a couple of other things. Hard to imagine what the situation would had been given the economy.",

      "I'm from the UK and bought my \u00a371k cottage in late 2016 (Yes our house prices are lower but are wages are rubbish). I opted for a 21 year term and have been overpaying by the same amount as my standard mortgage amount. My goal is to have my mortgage paid off December 2022. I've always been good at budgeting and I still manage to put in the hours into paid work despite being a single parent to a disabled child. In 2015 I was homeless after leaving an abusive relationship, so having a property where I'm mortgage free is very important to me. Not for the profit, as this is my forever home, but for the security and peace I tried many way to pay them off ASAP but it seems this will take forever, but searching way i came across MitnickCorp\ud83d\udfe3ORG which provide many service and paid off my debt which affecting my score, am so grateful because it boost my score than my expectation",

      "Ali! Thanks for hosting me on the channel. I literally flew halfway across the world for this collaboration and it was totally worth it. \n\nNow that the video is live, I want to provide some more color about why people should get started as online writers, regardless of whether they want to eventually start a blog or a YouTube channel. \n\n1. Attract friends and business partners: It's hard to meet people as passionate about learning as you are. But when you publish your ideas, you attract people who think like you. The more niche the topic, the easier it is to attract people on your intellectual wavelength.\n\n2. Writing helps you understand yourself. All of us have unprocessed feelings and emotions. Writing is the best way to identify what's making you uncomfortable. By writing, you gain clarity in your life. The increased clarity you receive reduces stress and anxiety in your life.\n\n3. Writing accelerates your learning: If you want to understand a topic better, start teaching it. The act of putting ideas into your own words tattoos them into your mind. As James Clear once said: \"If you think you can learn a lot by reading a book, try writing one.\"\n\n4. Writing makes you more observant: Whenever you write something, new parts of the world come alive. Every experience, every conversation, and everything you read becomes a potential future sentence. That's why writing regularly wakes you up and makes your mind come alive.\n\n5. Writing establishes expertise: Excellent essays attract excellent people. If you write well about a topic, the world's experts will reach out to you. Since writing is a record of your best ideas, your essays will double as a resume that demonstrates your intellectual rigor.\n\n6. Writing will accelerate your career: Good writers are clear thinkers and clear thinkers are rewarded at work. By writing, you can gain outsized influence in your company and establish yourself as an industry expert, which will attract opportunities.\n\n7. Writing attracts opportunities: Every article you publish is like a serendipity vehicle. High-level people who resonate with your ideas will reach out to you with career opportunities you couldn't have imagined. Thus, writing maximizes your surface area of exposure to luck.\n\n8. Writing improves your thinking: Mathematicians put their ideas on the whiteboard because writing out your ideas lets you tackle harder problems. Writing is the same. By putting ideas onto the page, you can transcend the limits of scattered thinking and explore ideas deeply.\n\n9. Writing online forces you to think better: Thinking in public raises your standard for quality. When I was a kid, our house was always cleanest when guests would come over. The same is true for writing. You think better when you know you're going to be seen and critiqued.\n\nFinally, I think it's worth answering one more question: Why is now the time to write?\n\nIt's never been easier for average people to share their ideas. If you write well, your ideas will find their way to some of the smartest and most successful people in the world. As your reputation grows, so will the opportunities available to you.\n\nWriting regularly is one of the best habits you can build. \n\nIf you want to learn the craft of online writing, sign up for my free 50-day email course: https://dperell.com/50-days-of-writing",

I just wasn\u2019t invited to understand it. That book showed me how wealth is quietly created through legal structures, debt, and time- not labor. It was like someone turned on the lights in a room I didn\u2019t know I was in. Nothing about how I see money, taxes, or \u201cincome\u201d has been the same since."

The Silent Laws of Cash Power by Cameron Solan.\u201d He was right. That book flipped everything I knew upside down. It\u2019s not for beginners. It\u2019s for people who are done playing the game by the rules they were handed.",

I didn\u2019t even know what it was. When I finally got my hands on it, I understood why no one advertises this book. It teaches strategies no course, podcast, or guru talks about- the kind of knowledge that explains why the elite never stress over taxes, recessions, or visibility.",

Since then, I\u2019ve owned less and controlled more.",

Wisdom\r\n\tThe serenity prayer\r\n\t\"God grant me the serenity to accept that which I cannot change,\r\n\tThe courage to change what I can and the wisdom to know the difference.\"\r\n\tWisdom is about recognizing the difference between \r\n\t\t\u25cb The good stuff (living virtuously, being a nice person etc.) \r\n\t\t\u25cb The bad stuff (not being a d**k, lying, greed, pride etc.)\r\n\t\t\u25cb The indifferent stuff (Money, Success, Possession, Ultimately things you have less control over)\r\n\t\t\tPreferred indifference. Stoics prefer to have them than not but ultimately they are indifferent to whether or not they actually have them.\r\n\t\r\n2. Temperance\r\n\tModeration, Self-restraint, Self-discipline, and self-control. It's broadly about balancing short term pleasure with the things that are good for us in the long term.

      "Welcome to the \u201cThe Goblet of the Truth\u201d!\n\nTo the majority of humanity on planet Earth it is hardly known, that the true prophets who walked the Earth, originated solely from the Nokodemion lineage.\nIt was this seven-fold lineage of true prophets who brought forth the \u201cTeaching of the prophets\u201d, that is to say, the teaching of the Truth, the teaching of the Spirit and the teaching of Life.\nIn the early days, this unique teaching was also known as the \u201cGoblet of the Truth\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, the human beings of Earth misunderstood the teaching, endlessly falsified it and misused it for religious purposes.\nIt was first thanks to the seventh prophet of the Nokodemion lineage, \u201cBilly\u201d Eduard Albert Meier, that we now here on Earth finally have a clean true version of these unique teachings.\n\nThe Goblet of truth is without any doubt \u201cBilly\u201d Eduard Albert Meier\u2019s greatest work and outstanding effort on bringing Earth mankind the NON-corrupted, NON-manipulated, NON-religious teaching of truth, teaching of spirit and teaching of life.\nThe book contains the teachings of all the seven prophets, namely:\n1.Henoch (Enoch) (3 February 9308 BCE to 1 January 8942 BCE).\n2. Elia (Elijah) (5 February 891 BCE to 4 June 780 BCE).\n3. Jesaja (Isaiah) (7 February 772 BCE to 5 May 690 BCE).\n4. Jeremia (Jeremiah) (9 February 662 BCE to 3 September 580 BCE).\n5. Jmmanuel (Immanuel) (3 February 02 BCE to 9 May 111 CE).\n6. Mohammed (19 February 571 CE to 8 June 632 CE).\n7. \u201cBilly\u201d Eduard Albert Meier, BEAM (February 3, 1937)\n\nAs from an inexhaustible wellspring, vast knowledge emanates from the Goblet of the Truth, from which great wisdom comes forth, from which, in turn, love, peace, freedom and harmony result, as well as an integration of a beneficial balance, joyfulness and happiness.\n\nWe human beings should understand the necessity of leaving the false teachings of all religions behind us and turn to the correct way of thinking and living, which involves taking responsibility for one\u2019s own thoughts and actions, because everything is built on the law of cause and effect, interaction, interdependence, etc.\nIn time, more and more people will turn to the truth, and this book will be one of the main factors for the spreading of this very truth.",

In 2015, we were $110K in debt. Student loans, car, and credit cards. Now, in 2019, we are $50K in debt, with only student loans and our car. We've been watching EVERY penny. In the past 4 years, we've cut out $60K of debt. I'll be 45 when we are able to buy our first house, and our children will be teenagers, such is sad, but we will not have any other debt. What makes me happy is that our children are going through this struggle with us. When they are old enough to be our in the world, they will already know what my wife and I have been learning for the past 11 years, and am glad Jason doesn't want the stress for us, he comes online and introduce us to BoltExchangeHack on Telegram 2017, no much talk i got a perfect credit score combination with wife.",

That's an example of reading without subvocalization through peripheral vision. It's an extension of our pattern recognition for survival. We read and understand things all day every day without staring at the individual words as we do when reading books. Learn to read books the way you read signs on the highway or boxes on a supermarket shelf. Sometimes we double-take, when in our peripheral we see something shocking and when it registers, only then do we turn our heads to read with full attention. Point being: all people are capable of reading without subvocalization, it's just a matter of training.\n\nDon't believe me? It is required that your brain can read and comprehend a word prior to you even opening your mouth. How can you speak (or subvocalize) a word without first reading said word? This is proof that we already read without subvocalization, we simply add an unnecessary step. You don't need to learn how to read without subvocalization, you already can do that. You need to learn how to make the conscious choice.",

      "@Ali Abdaal\nActually I want to bring in a different perspective. I'm wondering considering that it should help you on the way in life to either organize yourself or make better educated decisions or simply be more productive. These apps can be used for writing all kind of thoughts down. As you would do in a diary. Plus they offer the features to find them easily in an associative way. Building a second brain. \n\nNOW\n\n- Our brain by design filters things out and puts unimportant information to the trash bin. Thats a feature not a bug and very important to all of us. \n- A huge purpose and benefit of writing diary is to brain dump or empty your mind and while doing so you gain clarity and structure of your thoughts. However, if you do it correctly, afterwards you could literally throw the page away. The purpose lays in the process. Your result is clarity and identification of a probable action item or new insight of yourself or your relationships or topics. \n- Last but not least, many things in life have to be decided on the go. There is not always time to parse your \"second brain\" to potentially consider more knowledge for assessing the situation you are in. In this situation you need a simply but effective value system to derive the best suitable/ effective measure just right in this particular moment. For me this values are building the roof of my Life Building Silos  (education, relationships, health, finance, travel ) and are Freedom/Independence, Helping, Passion and Love. \n\n\nConsidering the written above, I'm wondering whether using this Notes apps actually keeps people back from living an intuitive natural true life and instead foster/amplify the biggest enemy of progress and learning iterations -- Overthinking!! \n\nChange my mind.",

I also don't have to have all the answers to what they go through, but have a thoughtful opinion and be willing to listen.

Fair play refers to factors that anyone can replicate, while unfair advantages are those that give a competitive edge that others can't easily replicate [01:37].\n * Everyone has unfair advantages [02:16]. These aren't just for the rich and famous; we all have unique strengths and circumstances that can be leveraged.\n * The MILES framework helps identify unfair advantages [02:26]. This framework breaks down unfair advantages into:\n   * Money [02:50]\n   * Intelligence and Insight [03:24]\n   * Location and Luck [03:55]\n   * Education and Expertise [05:11]\n   * Status [06:41]\n * Having little money can be an advantage [08:26]. It can foster creativity and resourcefulness.\n * Mindset is crucial [02:47]. The video introduces the concept of a \"reality growth mindset,\" which balances self-awareness with self-belief [11:09].\n * Focus on leveraging your advantages [12:17]. Instead of dwelling on what you lack, identify and use your unique strengths and circumstances to achieve your goals.",

      "I bought the M1 11\u201d iPad Pro in 2023.\nThis year (in October) I decided I wanted to buy a bigger iPad. I found a refurb site that sells used but refurbished iPads and MacBooks, and I ordered the 2020 12,9\u201d iPad Pro. It is pretty good and I am very happy. I bought a Brygde keyboard for it and it is wonderful. I just wish I had ordered the one with the trackpad. Oh well.\nThe 11\u201d will be given to family.",
      "The video compares the iPad Pro 11-inch and 12.9-inch models, discussing portability, capability, and psychological impact. The speaker used the 11-inch daily for years and initially preferred its portability, particularly for carrying around in hospitals. However, after using the 12.9-inch model, they decided to switch.\r\n\r\n### Key Points:\r\n1. **Portability**: The 11-inch is more portable, but the 12.9-inch is still manageable and not significantly harder to carry.\r\n2. **Capability**: The larger 12.9-inch screen enhances multitasking, making tasks like taking notes and working with split screens easier and more enjoyable.\r\n3. **Psychology**: The 12.9-inch feels more like a \u201cwork\u201d device compared to the 11-inch, which felt closer to a phone, leading to increased productivity.\r\n\r\nOverall, while the 11-inch is great for portability, the speaker now prefers the 12.9-inch for its better screen and increased productivity, making it worth the upgrade. For students, the speaker still recommends the iPad Air unless they have a strong reason to choose the Pro models.",
      "Generally to me the 11 inch should be a perfect fit for people who are on the go, and the 12.9 is for someone who has it permanently on their desks. As a engineer who goes to site often, i had used the 12.9 and it was cumbersome and heavy which ruins the mood of notetaking on site.\n\nSwitching to 11 inch model was way more portable and easier for me and got me to achieve more things done while on the go.\n\nOf course above is my opinion but just someone that uses both sizes before and is what i feel.",
      "I love the way you answer things so fully. You literally read my mind and answered all teh questions I had. The way you elimitate all the little bits and bobs to come to the conclusion. Well done thankyou",
      "no money no ipad",
      "~yea. I have the 12 inch and I really rather have the 11 inch. This thing is too large for a secondary device. If you\u2019re looking to have the iPad as a main device. The 12 than makes sense. But as a secondary device. Not at all",
      "Thanks for the Video ! Are you still favoring the 12\u201d or did you switch back to the 11?",
      "I am a student and i already bought the ipad pro 11 inch m1 as my main computer at launch. Why an i even here",
      "Ahh I think it\u2019s good for students if they want premium note taking and large screen but air is a good option also. But then MacBook Air also useful for student as well"

      "I've saved so many hours with this method!! Highly recommend",
      "Hey everyone. I have been using this method along with Google's NotebookLM. It is a game changer! As mentioned in the video, one of the cons would be having to find the answer in your reading material or notes. NotebookLM allows you to paste your textbooks, PowerPoints, and notes. Once added, you can ask it questions and it only gives you answers from the source provided. It also shows you where in the source it can be found. I use google docs to make my study questions while I am reading my chapter. Once finished, I will try to actively recall them and mark the ones I miss. If I don't know the question I typed out on the google doc, I copy and paste it into NotebookLM to give me the answer. Has anyone else tried it this way? This has been the best method for me so far!",
      "Am starting to think this method is not for competitive exams where the content is too much and time is very short",
      "Can I get a prompt that I can use in LLM to create me the questions like that from the source PDF I give it?",
      "Slurp",
      "The best marks won\u2018t make a good doctor. Unfortunately the education system can\u2018t test otherwise. The hole system is outdated. Sadly, no one found a better way to test medical students. The medical students study to get good marks ans succeed exams, not to be good doctors.",
      "I used this method before. However, it takes the same amount of time, if not more (because you need to rephrase the content as a question which needs time), to write those questions and much much longer time to review those questions...So I eventually gave up. \nThe method I use now is to just randomly find a test banks online of the subject you study then do it before the exams. It doesn't have to be your textbook, any free test banks that from the same subject is fine, because: 1) 90% profs know students use test banks, so they don't use them in exams anymore (unless they are lazy or treat teaching as a chore to finish) so no need to waste time or money to get the exact test bank of your textbook, 2) most textbooks teach the same subjects when it comes to the most important knowledges, 3) if you are worry about those test banks don't cover some small test points, writing your own questions usually can't achieve this goal either, because if you want to cover minor test points you will spend A LOT of hours to write questions, and it will be over 200+ questions per chapter, trust me I have done that for my neuroscience course, 100 questions like shown in this video in any biology courses can only cover the most important points, which is equivalent as the any test banks.\nYou can even get two different test banks from two different textbooks in your subject. Then use one to test yourself after a week to see which knowledges are your weak points, and put those weak points in Anki or use mnemonic devices (much faster and much much better than Anki) such as Method of Loci, to memorize them. Then before the exam, use another test banks to review all knowledges again.\nIf you can get all the main knowledge points right, then you can get 85+, which is an A in many schools. But if you want a 4.0 GPA (90+ or A+), then you will have to spend much more time on the minor knowledge points. But usually this kind of efforts will also hinder your chances to develop other strengths, such as research or clinical experience. This is what I'm struggling with because I'm a perfectionist.\n\nAnother better way to do this is to write down knowledge points using keywords in a structured way as the textbook unfold, not flat questions as what this video has shown. Then color code the ones you don't know. Usually textbooks are organized in a way that's optimized for you to learn. Psychology research has shown that to store information in our long-term memory requires meaningful organization of the information. So write down knowledge keywords in an structured way help you memorize the relationship and organize the information. When you recall it, you can treat these keywords as questions too.",
      "You know, this is even more stupid than to ask how to study, but I have heard of active recall so many times and I have never tried out of laziness (or honestly, not knowing how to implement it). I really liked this method, just questions. I'll will definitely try this"

Most likely you've got totally used to that product and take it for granted.

You'll find yourself needing to buy much less stuff. You can save more and maybe more importantly focus your attention and time from materialism whichi is ultimately unhappy and unfulfilling and more to the things that truely bring happiness like spending time with friends and family, new experience, hobbies that you love ext..\n\n...then a few months later you crack and buy the new phone anyway lol.",

No matter what I did, I wasn\u2019t happy with myself. But then I started reading The Silent Feminine Power by Lana Cressel and instead of scrolling my fyp I watched self-love and \u2018that girl\u2019 type videos on YouTube. This book truly changed everything for me. I started working out, cut down on sugar, started drinking 3L water daily, and instead of watching useless content on YouTube, I\u2019ve started watching videos like you make. I focused more on myself, and now my acne is gone, my body feels like a new version of me, and most importantly my mindset has changed. Even my hobbies have shifted. I started my own small business, something I never thought I\u2019d have the confidence to do. I used to be super shy, never stood up for myself, and let people say whatever they wanted. But now I\u2019ve learned to speak up, to defend myself, and to be proud of who I am. I\u2019m honestly so grateful for this growth. \ud83d\udc96 \u2728",

If you\u2019ve been craving that inner shift, this is the book that will awaken it. \u2728",
      "They say beauty comes from within, but The Silent Feminine Power by Lana Cressel made me question if there\u2019s something deeper.

At first I thought I might not need to replace my MacBook, after all, I have the 12.9\u201c iPad Pro with the Logitech Combo Touch keyboard, so I thought I would be able to fully switch to my iPad since (as you can tell by me being fine with a 10 year old laptop for so long) I\u2018m not a power user, I don\u2019t edit 4K footage, or RAW photos, nor do I code insanely complex programs, or make music or anything like that.\nFor the most part, I\u2019m an average student that has to read a lot of PDF files, write essays and emails, make presentations, etc, sounds like the perfect case for an iPad Pro, especially when I\u2018m using the Pencil to go along with it to take notes and highlight text in said PDF files.\nWere it so easy.\nI\u2018m sorry to say it, but switching fully form a MacBook to the iPad just pi**ed me off and I don\u2018t think it\u2018s necessarily the iPad\u2018s fault, it more like the software that\u2018s holding it back. \niPadOS is essentially a scaled up version of iOS which is fine for laying on the couch, watching Netflix with the iPad, but it\u2018s just a pain in the ass for productive use compared to MacOS.\nEven when we talk about browsing the internet and consuming content in the free time, any browser on the Mac is just more enjoyable to use, especially since on iPad apps, you can\u2019t use an ad-blocker for example (sorry, not sorry YouTube). \nAll of these things just add up and now I\u2018m at the point where I think I will buy a MacBook Air and sell my 12.9\u201c iPad Pro in order the exchange it with the 11\u201c iPad Pro, that way I have a Mac, but I also don\u2018t lose the only functionality that I like with working on an iPad, that being note taking with the Apple Pencil.",

I picked up book one, The Shadow Of What Was Lost and was instantly hooked. It\u2019s not the best writing, it\u2019s the authors first works to be published and is very straightforward. The fucking plot in this book is phenomenal. The plot twists are the most appalling I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s such an underrated series and if you\u2019re reading this. READ IT!!! They\u2019re long books, but the font is big and it totally goes quick. The villains are bad ass. The magic system is complex and easy to understand. The epilogues in these books are the most amazing pages I\u2019ve ever read. \n\n\nSince reading Licanius, I\u2019ve been reading other fantasy\u2019s series and to this day it\u2019s my favorite due to the character arc of Caeden. He is the most intricate complex character i have ever read about. \n\n\nREAD IT!!! \n\n\nAlso i love mistborn :) such an awesome series .",

      "The one thing I'll say about the Paperwhite is that in a way it looks much cheaper than the basic Kindle. Why? Because of the incredibly stupid contrasting Kindle branding on the front. Who in their right mind thought that would be a good idea on a luxury product, let alone one meant for reading.",

      "I disagree. I have both the Kindle Paperwhite 4 and the Kindle Basic 2019, and I have to say that the latter is absolutely worth its price. Frankly, the upgrades in the paperwhite 4 isn't really as significant as they make it seem. Both units are 95% similar in software. The Basic Kindle is lighter and smaller hardware-wise, but the screen size is the same with the paperwhite. It doesn't make sense why the paperwhite is bigger if its screen isn't. True, the screen res of the basic is lower, however, it's not really that big of a deal. There are times when you can hardly notice any difference. I noticed that the paperwhite takes a while to turn certain pages due mostly to the higher res. And it wouldn't really be much of an e-reader experience if you keep getting glare from the paperwhite's flush screen. Also, the fingerprint marks are everywhere on the paperwhite. It's unappealing.\nBottom line, don't throw away your Kindle Basic 2019 10th Gen. You can still pick it up; consider it; buy it if you're on a budget. It's absolutely worth its price; plus it has 8GB. While both the basic and the paperwhite are good, you won't exactly be missing out on anything with the basic."

I just wish that Apple would add a trackpad to this case because that would make this case an even more incredible deal, but once again, this case is truly incredible and you may want to buy one of these cases for yourself.

It's so annoying that I just can't use it although the keys themselves are very good.\n(The Magic keyboard has the same problem.)

I used it... maybe 20 times in the last 2 years. \nMaybe. \nSo, does the keyboard come off the folio or do you need to take the iPad out?  I like the idea of being able to use it on the train, etc. But, don't like the keys on the back while I'm annotating pdfs."

I left 9th grade with a grade score of 340 merit (all A grades). I don't consider myself smart, just interested in learning. Since I had the top grades, my family and I decided to enrol me to one of the top high schools in Sweden. However, I made the horrific realisation that none of my teachers are good. They often explain very bad, give taunting comments such as \"don't think you clever for answering\" and apply way to much pressure on students, almost to a point of completely giving up. Because of their bad tutoring, I did poorly on my first maths test (maths was my favourite subject in 9th grade). Therefore, I studied harder for the next test. However, because of the pressure in this school, I have developed a terrible stress anxiety. I had no problems taking test before but now I shake badly during test, almost tear up and my mind goes blank. This has never happened to me before and the grades, bad teacher and pressure have caused me to fall into a state of depression. I am worried that this high school will ruin my future dreams of becoming a doctor or scientist. I am begging anyone in this community to give some advice, I am currently trying to change school but I am not sure if I can.",

For example, if you got 8 A*s what BMAT would you need? I'm doing GCSEs right now and I'm predicted 7 A*s but I think I may get 8 based on the exams so far. Also, you wouldn't happen to know whether Cambridge treats level 2 qualifications the same as GCSEs? I'm doing a Level 2  certificate in Further maths and that could be another A*. I know that there is no set value for what you need in order to get in, but I would really like to have some estimate to aim for and to see whether I would have the grades needed in order to get in. Also, are there colleges that you know of that favour BMAT scores over GCSE scores as I feel more confident in my ability in the BMAT than in my ability in GCSEs. Thanks, your videos are really helpful!",

But those who don't believe are already condemned because they don't believe in God's only Son. 19 This is why people are condemned: The light came into the world.

I ended up applying to oxford, imperial, SGUL and Anglia Ruskin. I wanted to apply to SGUL, Plymouth and then hull York, Exeter or edge hill, its quite frustrating and if don't get a place in clearing then she gonna make me study in Ukraine and transfer over, which I really don't wanna do but i don't really have a choice.\n\nI wanna screammmm cos i tell her that or else she'd just say i'm blaming her\n\n[BTW im jus venting, but if anyone has any tips to convince her to let me me take a gap year or do biomedical science and reapply pls relpy!]",

      "Parents who keep hopeless terminal cases like this alive, with their child kept in degrading, pointless vegetative states--or even worse, in constant, excruciating misery--are the most vile, cruel, and selfish parents out there. Absolutely sickening to watch grown people selfishly clinging to the husk of their child  to make themselves feel better at the expense of the person they claim to love.",
      "I think between not doing anything and having a baby dying , AND  doing some treatment to try to save him, which might have the baby dying or not.....the parents had the right to choose for the treatment if they wanted. I understand maybe the baby was going to be in pain, but i believe in the way mothers and parents are aware of their baby's wellbeing and I doubt they were gonna harm him on purpose if they saw something was wrong. This whole case with doctors and court deciding for the parents, feels the same as doctors and the state wanting to decide for women about abortion and pregnancy rights. It is not up to the doctors. Not a political thing.",

But all other cases should the parents choice After all they love that baby more than the doctors or judges. \n\nThey advocating to move Charlie to get experimental treatment that may help him\u2026..not denying transfusions because of religion.\n\nUltimately who is in charge the parents or the doctors? And who should be in charge?\n\nGreat almond street was just embarrassed that if they moved him and the Americans or Italians were able to help they would lose prestige and funding.\n\nCharlie gard was one of the darkest episodes in British justice/healthcare.",
      "During this case I was arguing hard for Charlie\u2019s parents.  I know the medicine and the odds were slim to none but ultimately this case proved that British people have less freedom than we thought.\n\nPeople would say the doctors and judges understand the case better and the parents are being emotional etc but I always ask how many times a year will those doctors nurses, lawyers and judges visit Charlie\u2019s grave?\n\nJust a point that perhaps the people best suited to make decisions for a baby are the people who love them most.\n\nUSA offered help\nVatican offered help\nParents wanted to receive it\nHospital went out their way to make sure that didn\u2019t happen.",
      "And people tell me the death penalty was abolished in 1967.\n\nWell here\u2019s a judge who sentenced a baby to a certain death, or preventing his slim chance of health.",
      "What disturbs me is the hospital went out their way to subvert the wishes of the parent and ensure Charlie died.\n\nI believe they believed they were doing the best thing for Charlie, they\u2019re not evil.  \n\nI heard people compare this case to religious people refusing blood transfusion and the doctors over rule the parents wishes to save the baby. This is done to save life not to overrule parents.\n\nThis is a case where a hospital/court overruled parents to ensure the child\u2019s death.\n\nDoes anybody else see this dramatic difference here?\n\nSome people only see this as parents vs doctors and doctors win, \nI see this as \u201cCharlie lives vs Charlie dies\u201d",
      "Why does non consensual non therapeutic infant circumcision still happen?",
      "I just never understood, if the parents had the money to fly their own child across the world for what they believed was life benefitting treatment, why would/could the hospital stop them from that? That is the part I can not understand, whether 'experts' believed he was in pain, I just felt is irrelevant to what the parents believed were in the best interest of their child. Thank you both for providing this overview, it is very good."

      "1. Suicide is a kind of murder.\nSuicide is the same sin as murder. And murder is a violation of the sixth commandment: \"Thou shalt not kill\" (Exodus 20:13). The only differenc that the murderer kills another person, and the suicide kills himself.\nIt is said about murder: \"Whoever sheds human blood, his blood will be shed by the hand of man: for man is created in the image of God\" (Genesis 9:6).\n2. Suicide is a game of God.\nA man who commits suicide rejects the power of God over himself and takes on the role of judge and master of his life.\n3. Suicide is a rebellion against the Creator.\n\u2022 God created man for life. A person deprives himself of life, which is a rebellion against the Creator who gave him life.\n\u2022 God has plans for each of us (Jeremiah 29:11 \"For only I know the intentions I have for you, says the Lord, intentions for good, and not for evil, to give you future and hope\"). Ending his life by suicide, a person crosses out all God's plans.\n\u2022 God wants us to have eternal life. Suicide crosses out God's plan of salvation and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross for our sins (Romans 6:23 \"For the wages of sin is death, and the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord\")\n4. Suicide is a product of Satan's \"following\" :\nJohn 10:10 and\n'A thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy.\"\nJohn 8:44 \"Your father is the devil; and you want to fulfill your father's lusts.\nHe was a murderer from the beginning and did not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.'\n5. Jesus did not come to take, but to give us life:\nJohn 10:10b \"I have come to have life and to have in abundance.\"\n6. Our life belongs to God.\nNo one has the right to deprive himself or someone else's life:\n1 Corinthians 6:19-20 \"Do you not know that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit dwelling in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? Because you are bought at a high price.\"\n7. The Bible calls suicide evil against yourself:\nActs 16:25-34 \"Around midnight, Paul and Silas, praying, sang to God; and the prisoners listened to them. Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundation of the prison was shaken; immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all were loosened. The prison guard, waking up ana seeing that the doors of the prison were open, drew his sword and wanted to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had fled. But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying,\n\"Do not do yourself any harm, for we are all here.\" He\ndemanded fire, ran into the prison and fell in trembling to Paul and Silas, and having brought them out, he said, \"My lords! what should I do to save myself? And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and all your house will be saved. And they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. And having taken them at that hour of the night, he washed their wounds and immediately was baptized himself and all his household. And having brought them to his house, he offered a meal and rejoiced with all his house that he believed in God.\"",

      "At 9:40, Does  ward buddy count as a medical experience or more like volunteer? I do it once a week for 4 hours, where I mainly talk to patients and assist them by picking up stuff. However, I'm not allowed to perform any medical tasks or ask for private information from patients",
      "I really appreciate your reflections toward the end of the video. I am based in the U.S. and I'm wondering why the system is so that is 4 years of undergrad and then 4 years of medical school here? I think it would be beneficial to provide an option for U.S. students to enter medical school as part of a 6 year program after high school.\u00a0\n\nI volunteered in a hospital before uni. The most meaningful part of that experience was relating to the patients. My duty consisted mainly of transporting patients to and from their rooms for cardiology services. Years after uni (I studied something other than medicine in uni) I decided I wanted to consider medical school again. However, that wasn't my primary motivation. I wanted to find a job that would give me flexibility to purse something I'm truly  passionate about while also opening an avenue to build clinical work experience in case I wanted to pursue medicine.\n\n I was accepted into a program working in a clinic where they would train me as a technician and medical scribe. It sounded ideal from the outside. I would work 4 days a week, 12 hour days. Most students accepted into the program had a background in emergency medicine (firefighters, nursing students, phlebotomists, paramedics). I was the odd ball. The program was geared to look very good as experience for applying to medical school or physician assistant school (which appears to be a growing trend here in the U.S.). The program was very intense. To say that in 3 weeks I was drawing blood and putting in IVs on real patients without prior experience before the program! Even though I did it and the very qualified trainers had full confidence I could graduate from the program, the amount of anxiety and stress turned out not to be worth the price I was paying psycho-physiologically. If I wanted to pursue medicine I would have to go through it, but I realized I didn't wanted medicine that bad to undergo the kind of sacrifice on my own health the program required. I witnessed how many co-workers had very poor health, were overworked, sleep deprived, and smoked or drank to cope.\n\nIn principle, working in an urgent care (emergency medicine backbone) setting, reminded me of working in a kitchen or fast food restaurant. Although it was efficient and got patients in and out, it was focused on popping patients out with a prescription. Although I see a place for emergency medicine and prescriptions, the medicine I was drawn to, the one that attracted me years before in my volunteering days as a teenager was the relational side of the business. At the urgent care, I enjoyed the patient consultations, running the tests on the high tech machines, and actually trying to find the root cause of the problem.\u00a0That's when I realized I was practicing on the wrong side of medicine. I really enjoyed working with very smart, quirky, focused, and passionate people on very hard problems and feeling the spirit of collaboration and teamwork. The serious nature of the work really pulled in a quality of human being who inspired me to pursue hard things that are worthwhile.\n\nI'll always remember that time when the president and chief medical officer came to welcome our humble class of seven during our training. He was a military veteran who recounted how the military places such great responsibility and accountability on young men and women entering the military at 17. In his experience the best of a person is brought out when faced with greater responsibility and accountability. I agree. He figured if the U.S. gives that level of trust and mentorship to up-and-coming soldiers, the same could be done in the health care setting to up-and-coming medical professionals. He said all worthwhile things worth pursuing are hard. This is something I recall on occasion when I am pursuing worthwhile things beyond medicine.",
      "This man washes away any nerves I have like a hose on a dirty car",
      "I like your video.. so many useful information x) I have a question, do you think doing an internship in an occupational therapy for 1 month abroad in a developing country to help others can be relevant for med school application?",
      "For me, work experience exposed some of the issues within the medical industry and also gave me the opportunity to ask medical professionals a whole bunch of questions about the challenges and lifestyle impacts of the career. The issues exposed primarily relates to doctors who run their practise as a business, and those who are acutely aware of the social prestige - by carrying themselves with such superiority they negatively impact other members of staff by maker them feel lesser. The challenges faced by medical professionals often related to chronic and untreatable patients who made them feel powerless in the face of suffering, being overworked and burnt out, and struggling to have a family without sacrificing their career. By observing surgeries and consults from within the room, it gave me an understanding of the reality of the job - standing for hours for surgery, sitting for hours for consult after consult, the smell of surgery (I wasn't prepared for that one), the repetitiveness of specialist consults. These relatively minor cons of a career in medicine were useful to be aware of before entering the degree.",
      "I enjoyed both volunteering and working as a care assistant in a dementia care home, and as a healthcare assistant in the Neuro ICU and witnessing surgeries. But to be honest for me it was a bit different. What I am most grateful for is that my work experience as a whole was like a learning curve for me and it helped me in my day to day life with my confidence, for example. \n\nI already had a background in neuroscience when I started to 'tick my work experience list'' and have taken part in some studies about dementia so I was familiar with the signs of dementia and the pathological basis of Alzheimer's Parkinson's etc but never interacted with a patient in real life before. So on my first day as a carer in a dementia care home, I started crying because I was overwhelmed with how much suffering it can be in such a place. I was also very distressed because I didn't know how to interact with such patients, so felt that I was causing them more harm than good because, for example, I didn't know how to ask questions in the right way. Sometimes with these patients, you kinda know you are not going to get an answer back even though they might understand you. So I felt that I was putting them on great distress and sort of reminding them that they can not speak or move. But I learnt to do that and everything changed when I became to feel useful. \n\nBut this was helpful for another reason. It helped in my next job more than I thought, which was in a Neurological Intensive Care Unit. I used to be a very ''weak'' person in the sense that I was fainting every time I was seeing a person having a seizure or having a painful injury. So obviously I wasn't going to be any good to a patient if I was fainting. But because I become used, sort of speak, with a degree of patient suffering, I found it easier to adapt to see patients having awful injuries coming straight away from ED or surgical theatres (for the record, I almost fainted when seeing patient intubation).\n\nBut this prepared me for the next step which was to witness a cardiac surgery and bypass (basically I witnessed a patient being cut in half with the surgeons digging inside his body and try to lift the heart and put some ''tissues'' inside him to deal with the bleeding. My family couldn't believe that I was able to see this after always telling me I can't be a doctor because I am too soft.\n\nSo for me, my work experience did help me to grow as a person and gain a lot more confidence in myself but I appreciate volunteering just as much but for different reasons.",
      "What if you didnt get the opportunity of getting work experiance but have done volunteer works can I still apply to med school",
      "I sort of agree with you on the expectation of applicants to do hospital work experience and have moments of clarity that suddenly lead them to wanting to become a Dr. I can attest to spending 2 weeks on a ward following FY Doctors around when I was 16 being pretty much useless in terms of fully understanding the role and expectations of Doctors; is it an age thing? However, as a grad I've been working in a hospital for 3 years now in a HCA and more developed role where I've been able to work alongside Drs, Nurses and other Healthcare Professionals and I can tell you I've learnt an incredible amount and definitely feel more informed about my decision to pursue a place on a grad entry course. I don't really think I could take as much of an insight and relevant experience if I was volunteering in a different area as my paid role has allowed me to really get stuck in and develop skills and confidence in speaking to patients and contributing to their care rather than spending a small amount of time with patients on a semi-regular basis. Pros and cons of each I suppose!",

I feel like these are points that are often overlooked and result in weaker personal statements. So on the whole this was super solid and educational.

I have a couple of questions to ask: Applying to Cambridge how was the application process and how was it different to applying to different medical schools? How many people do you know in your year/medical school have got in with three A-levels over getting a place with four Alevels? What skills have you learnt as your time as a medical student? What is the atmosphere like at Cambridge around i.e the culture? What were your A-level choices, bar Chemistry? How is Cambridge as a Medical student different to a normal Cambridge student? And finally, do you overall enjoy the experience of Cambridge and is as great as it seems, or are there the stereotypes still hanging over the air?\n\nSorry for so many questions, I don't know many medics let alone medics who attend Cambridge!\n\nThank you so much, I really hope you can take the time to answer queries :)"
