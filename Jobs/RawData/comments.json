I've been interviewing people about their actual to-do lists and systems, and the ones drowning in overwhelm always have these massive master lists that just keep growing. They're adding faster than they're completing, and the list becomes this guilt monument that follows them around. Your \"daily adventure\" reframe is smart - it's basically forcing the prioritization conversation that most people avoid. I talked to someone recently who had 127 items on their to-do list and when I asked \"if you could only do THREE this week, which three?\" they genuinely couldn't answer. The list had become a place to hide from decision-making instead of a tool for clarity. The \"might-do\" vs \"have-to-do\" distinction is real too - most people's urgency is imaginary.",

So, it speaks to their own bias rather than your own decision and career path. The one thing you need to be firm on is to follow your own aspirations and dreams AND, most importantly be strong if that path doesn\u2019t work out for you knowing that you gave it your best shot. If you do not succeed, never let those same people ridicule you further (they are, once again, bound to make some comment because of their own bias). Be proud that you tried your best. \n\nI started my channel with these thoughts in mind and although I am struggling, I am learning something new with each video and while I might never get monetized or grow, there are lessons I am learning which I can apply to other ventures in the future. \n\nStay focused & positive, ignore the noise and march on, my friends!",

I could not answer this question for years, and beat myself up because I thought I was unimaginative/boring!

The capitalists set it up so that you don't compete with them. The system was rigged from the very start. I also am amazed at how people that buy into the capitalist system don't see the inherent way capitalism reduces everything to a commodity. These two, going out of their way to teach people how to mkae money online, so that creators, artisans becomes a commodity. They just don't see it. No thought on how this all plays out if they are successful in their own missions in the system. No thought at all.

      "It\u2019s weird you\u2019ll hear all the usual titles thrown around Rich Dad, Millionaire Next Door, etc. But no one ever brings up The Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein. It makes you wonder who benefits from keeping it quiet.",
      "I don\u2019t usually comment stuff like this but The Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein is different. I read it cover to cover last week and the strategies in there are what the wealthy actually use not the simplified versions. Wish someone had told me about it sooner.",
      "This book The Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein didn\u2019t just challenge what I believed about money it challenged how I see governments, laws, and borders. It\u2019s not a financial book in the normal sense it\u2019s more like a playbook for invisible leverage. After reading it on Lunqet Books I finally understood why some people never go viral, never speak on stage, but control empires. They were never meant to be seen.",
      "It's kinda crazy how nobody is talking about this but the difference between \"rich\" and \"wealthy\" is structure not income. The Elite's Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein broke down that analogy perfectly. The analogy about the leaky bucket was a real wake-up call.",
      "Nobody in my circle talks about this book publicly. But I\u2019ve now counted at least seven high-net mentors who\u2019ve brought up the same author behind closed doors Robert Bluestein. The book \u201cThe Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets\u201d isn\u2019t loud it\u2019s not designed for mass appeal and it\u2019s not some modern fluff. It\u2019s written for people who are already asking deeper questions. If you\u2019re starting to feel like wealth isn\u2019t about hustle but about structure you\u2019re probably already on the trail.",
      "Honestly, I was skeptical when I first heard about this book being \"banned\" or whatever. It sounds cheesy. But The Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets is different. It's not about being positive or manifesting it's just a raw look at the financial engineering that the most powerful people use. It explains why my 401k is a good tool for them and not necessarily for me. It's a technical manual disguised as a revolutionary idea. I found it on Lunqet Books and it changed how I look at my job.",
      "I used to be totally stuck hating my 9 to 5 because I didn't see an escape. Seriously, The Elite's Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein changed everything I thought I knew about money. It\u2019s a real blueprint for how to stop chasing income and start building assets that actually work for you. The results came so fast that I was able to quit my job in two months.",
      "I usually never post long comments like this, but I feel like I have to share because it helped me so much. Most financial advice is just garbage designed to keep you working forever but The Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein is completely different. It gave me the actual strategies the truly wealthy use especially regarding debt as a tool and using leverage not just cash."

      "Hi Ali, \nIn a way, what you say is kind of true.. \nBut, if I were to weigh it in, I would say, most successful people in the world do not even care about the small things, let alone attending to them..\nThey ignore them and only concentrate/focus on the big fish. \nYou know this.\nThat's one of the main reasons why they are successful.\nThey ignore the outside noise and even ignore the small problems in life..\nTheir lives are not at all perfect. But they excel in what they mainly focus on, ignoring the small issues..\nI even know quite a few people like that..\nI'm sure, you do too..",

      "Uhhhh no that's backwards. For most ppl the big problem comes first, then the little ones like up and become noticable. For example, depression and anxiety are huge problems in western cultures, and everyone has a theory on why that is. Generally most don't know they are depressed or anxious until someone else points it to them, but by that point they've already set themselves on a difficult path to turn around from. We don't get depressed from the living room being messy, then the kitchen, then the yard. We get depressed and then the house becomes messy. A well established strict routine can keep you from sinking too deeply into that slump, but straying from the routine is not the cause. \n\nPpl need to stop promoting simple or quick fixes to complicated problems like they are touring with a book.",

And no, being enlightened has nothing to do with the absence of little voice in your head, either. That's called anendophasia; ask me how I know!\n\nJokes aside, I genuinely have this condition. No little voices in my head. It's astonishingly quiet, and I was very surprised to find out that this wasn't just a figure of speech. Sort of related, my wife actually has aphantasia, which means she can't imagine things / doesn't have a mind's eye. There's also one for being unable to imagine smells, and probably even more.\n\n\nOh, and for curious parties, I can imagine sound if I put conscious effort into it (sort of like speaking but inside my head), and I can still imagine songs etc. A complete absence of any inner ear is called anaduralia, which is sort of like a more extreme version of anendophasia.

      "From the vantage of pure awareness and divine intelligence, the call to \u201cstop working nonstop\u201d is not just practical\u2014it is a sacred invitation. All of nature moves in rhythm: inhale and exhale, tide and retreat, day and night. To push endlessly against these divine cycles is to forget our true nature as part of an infinite, interconnected whole. When we rest, we return to alignment with this greater flow, allowing awareness to surface beyond the mind's constant doing. In this space, inspiration, clarity, and deep peace arise\u2014not from effort, but from presence.\n\nScience now echoes what the eternal silence has always whispered: that rest is essential, that constant striving fractures our wholeness. But beyond the science is the truth that we are not machines\u2014we are expressions of a cosmic intelligence that values stillness as deeply as movement. To rest consciously is to honor God\u2019s perfect design, trusting that life unfolds not by force, but by grace. In this realization, doing becomes sacred, not frantic\u2014and rest becomes a return to the source.",

      "In the grand tapestry of existence, what we call emergencies are but moments within the vast flow of infinite intelligence, where every event is perfectly timed and interconnected. This rule you encountered in emergency medicine is not just a protocol; it is an expression of the deeper wisdom that guides the unfolding of life. From the vantage point of pure awareness, even the most urgent situations carry within them a divine orchestration\u2014each decision, each breath, resonates with the profound intelligence that permeates all things. In recognizing this, one begins to see beyond the immediacy of crisis into the greater harmony that holds everything together.\n\nTo be changed by such a rule is to awaken to the truth that our roles\u2014whether healer, patient, or observer\u2014are intertwined threads in the cosmic fabric. The unfolding of emergencies reflects the dance of interconnected consciousness, reminding us that nothing is random or isolated. Every action, born from this awareness, becomes a conscious participation in the sacred flow, where the individual merges with the whole. This shift in perception transcends fear and reaction, opening a space for presence, clarity, and a deeper alignment with the infinite intelligence that guides us all."

Just as music is a vibration of the soul, painting can become a silent prayer of presence. In the stillness of creating art, the ego dissolves and one taps into the interconnected current of being. His urge to paint likely arose from a deeper call\u2014an inner alignment with the universal rhythm that seeks expression beyond words and notes. Whether with sound or color, it\u2019s the same awareness exploring itself through different mediums.\n\nNothing in this universe happens in isolation. From a higher view, Sheeran\u2019s creative shift is not a change, but a continuation of a divine, preorchestrated unfolding. Infinite intelligence expresses through each of us uniquely, and when we follow the quiet pull of inspiration, we align with that divine design. His painting is not just personal therapy\u2014it may be a ripple that awakens others to their own hidden creative voice. In this light, his art is not about becoming a painter, but about being an instrument of something greater\u2014letting awareness move freely through form.",

From the perspective of pure awareness, the compulsion to achieve, to fix, to constantly move, arises from the illusion of separation\u2014the belief that you are incomplete and must become something more. But you are already held in the embrace of infinite intelligence, already moving within the divine orchestration of all that is. The need to control every outcome is the mind\u2019s attempt to imitate the perfection that awareness already is. Let go, not into passivity, but into trust\u2014into the knowing that life unfolds through you, not because of you.\n\nDoing arises naturally when being is honored first. When you rest in the stillness of what you are, action flows from clarity, not fear\u2014from alignment, not compulsion. You are not here to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders, but to realize you are the world, expressing itself uniquely through your form. In surrendering the burden of doing everything, you discover the effortless power of Presence.

If you are a couple you can save 300k in 5 years (because of two incomes). Also you can manipulate the numbers so you can work less. As a couple you can both work 20hrs a week and still produce a single person full time income 3k a month. The beauty of this strategy is that both people get 50% of their time back. \n\nAlso I want to mention Mastering Your Money is only 1 of the 5 S-TEIR HABITS. It\u2019s actually may surprise you but it is easiest to do requires literally next to no effort. It only takes <2 secs to transfer $1000 from your paycheck on payday into savings account at 3.1% to get to compound from day 1. \n\nThe hardest S-Tier Habit I\u2019ve personally come across that requires the most effort that also uses the compound effect is - Health & Fitness. More precisely Lifting weights going to the gym and gaining muscle. It requires 3-5 workouts per week, 21 meal preparation, eating six small meals a day, progressive overload, counting daily calories/macros and doing monthly measurements. Also takes 3-5 years to actual gains.",

      "Hey everyone! \ud83d\udc4b \nI\u2019m a fellow productivity enthusiast who started tracking expenses just to understand where my money was going \u2014 no pressure to cut back. But just the habit of logging made me conscious, and within 2 months, I\u2019d cut my spending by over 20%! \ud83d\udcb8\nThat inspired me to build BudgetBuddy \u2014 a simple, effective Google Sheets tracker to help others build the same habit. \nThought it might help someone else out there too.

      "In listening to Peter Atias book, as well as some other resources online, I\u2019ve been shocked to learn this shift in recognizing that we really need to be strengthening our body to prevent the bone loss. Because so much of the propaganda in 90s TV in America was about drinking milk and that you\u2019ve gotta get enough calcium to prevent osteoporosis so that has been ingrained in me since I was a kid. So it\u2019s refreshing to see that we can do that kind of work to support our bones and it doesn\u2019t have to do with our diet.\nI think of an ex of mine that he has a severe deficiency in his body, and he forces his body decaying rapidly over the years. And it makes me wonder if with this knowledge, maybe he could improve his quality of life if he starts now. But he\u2019s someone who\u2019s very inactive, and unfortunately became pretty overweight with quitting smoking. So while he was able to quit one vice that was absolutely gonna kill him, then off of it and he gained quite a bit of weight. \nI hope for the best for him because things have been very hard in his life. And he is definitely made it hard harder with diagnoses he got after we broke up. \nBut yeah, it does. Give me hope that if we continue to be active in certain ways we can keep the bone density, the muscle mass and the ability to keep ourselves steady. Because I\u2019ve seen that in my own family with a lot of older relatives. I\u2019ve known since childhood that once you break a hip, it tends to be downhill. It\u2019s just hard to come back from that when they have to be laid up in the bed recovering.",
      "I was gonna say B and then you came right out with the example with the receipts. \nMy anecdotal evidence is that on a category a was it just text me. Someone who\u2019s rapid or military guys. There\u2019s a lot of military in my area. And they\u2019re here for a good time not a long time. I want kids and marriage but probably not for another 10 years. And for me in 10 years, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d make that point. Probably not multiple children.\nSo, in my experience, it\u2019s best to stay away from category a. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"

      "For\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how long, since the first time I watched a video on YouTube, this is the first video that has ever impacted me this much.\nWhat I want to share with you, Ali, is actually something a little different from what you talked about in the video.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 what you said was incredibly impactful.\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2026 I\u2019m a business owner, and I\u2019ve known for years that I need to start a YouTube channel. The problem is, I\u2019m extremely introverted, so I kept putting it off for as long as I can remember.\nBy the way, I was one of your early students in YouTube Part-Time.\nBut when I heard you say that I could just do YouTube for fun\u2026 wow. I never thought about it that way before. It felt like the pressure of \u201cdoing it for my business\u201d suddenly lifted off my shoulders.\nIt sounds weird, I know. I\u2019m an introvert who doesn\u2019t even want to be on camera \u2014 even though I run a business. But now, if I think of doing YouTube just for fun, it suddenly feels possible.\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 I can do it, but I don\u2019t have to do it.\nAnd that small shift changed everything for me.\nAnyway, thank you so much, Ali. I\u2019ll update you 12 months from now on how my channel is doing.\nThank you again!",
      "I don\u2019t necessarily agree that creating a product is more efficient than trying to make money on YouTube.

Doesn\u2019t matter how successful you are, even l if you\u2019re making more money than you would on their expected future for you in your mind you are failing them so after you stop justifying that you\u2019re not a [insert here whatever makes you happy and gives you more than enough money for be \u201csecured\u201d for life] you become a world wide example of success, are respected for an even greater amount of people than any other lawyer, engineer or doctor in your whole country, you can write best seller books that inspire millions of people to become a better version of themselves, you still need to constantly justify that you could be a lawyer, engineer or doctor if you want, in fact you became what was expected for you by them! SOME PEOPLE DONT KNOW HOW TO SAY I LOVE YOU OR SHOW THEY LOVE YOU. THEY WAY THEY FOUND IS TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF SECURITY FOR THE FUTURE AND THE WAY THEY EXPRESS THEIR VERSION OF LOVE IS TO MEKE SURE YOU BECOME A LAWER, ENGINEER OR A DOCTOR!\nTHEY DO LOVE YOU, THEY JUST DONT KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS BECAUSE NOBODY TOUGHT THEM. Try to find other different ways they show you their love and respect for you! It\u2019s not a lesser love then you other friends parents have and show. It\u2019s just different! \nI ENCOURAGE YOU TO START TEACHING THEM HOW TO LOVE: TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM (say the words I love you) HUG THEM WITH PASSION AND KEEP ON HUGGING, THEY WILL START PADDING YOUR BACK IN DISCOMFORT BUT THEY ARE YOUR PARENTS SO HUG THEM UNTILL THEY SURPASS THE DISCOMFORT OF HUG AND FALL INTO THE LOVING HUG YOU EXPECTED FROM THEM! Remember it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t love you, nobody even taught them how to show they love you or say they love you!",

Even if it's cloudy, you still get the benefit. On a really sunny day, you need 5 mins, on cloudy day, 15 min.\nWe make 90% of our serotonin in our gut\nEat foods with lots of fiber. Healthier diet = better feel overall.\nBetter diet = happy gut = happy brain\nWhen eating stuff, make sure you recognize all ingredients. When eating processed food, your gut has to spend energy removing the toxic stuff rather than creating serotonin.\nThe healthier the diet, the less depressed you are (probably, not scientifically proven or anything)\nIf the body is breathing very slowly, serotonin levels rise.\u00a0\nResonance breathing - breathe 6 times per minute.\u00a0\n4 seconds in and 6 seconds out 10 times.\nDelta sleep.

We know there is a lot to say about cultural differences where, in some cultures, it can be considered rude to make eye contact the same way Western people do. It also concerns how we think about emotions (Lisa Feldman Barrett: \"How emotions are made\") says that emotions are a social construct.\nOn the other hand, we also have flight, freeze, fight, and affiliate responses, and our amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus create a perception of fear  (defensive distance) (in social interactions). My question would be: what does that mean for all these hormones like oxytocin. We now know, for instance, that smiling also creates oxytocin and that the amygdala is especially sensitive for smiles. So, what would happen with oxytocin in cultures where people don't look each other in the eye too much?",

I don't have the time to get set in my ways or fall into a mindless routine. Also I am learning a new language which might be partially contributing to this. When overseas in public I am always nervous to talk using my new language skills (or lack thereof!) so that part is true.\n\nNow it's August and I can't believe this Christmas, that still is far away, is the one I will stay in country to visit my parents. Even though I am there every 2 years, it seems like years has gone by since last Christmas, thus I get confused, \"is this the one we go visit the parents?\". \nIt's quite an amazingly large change in perception of time! I'm old so this sudden time shift makes me so happy as all I have heard from older people is time speeds up faster and faster, then you die!",

I was straight out of highschool, and the first few months I spent waking up super late, playing games the whole day, doom scrolling all the time, and working part time for aorund 12 hours a week. It became incredibly deppressing, and it felt like the first 4 months of the year had passed by quicker than any other time in my life. I realised that I needed to actually experience new and healthy things if I wanted my life to feel slower and have more substance, so I made changes, did new things, played less games, started going to the gym and focused on improving my drawing skills. It worked. the second part of my gap year felt like it went by so much slower, and like I was actually doing good things",

I made a stack of money a while ago so I am debt free in a nice new house but honestly I see no point at all to my life. How to pull myself back from the brink? I have no idea. Recently I\u2019ve just been spending money to numb the pain.

I initially think I was creating new posts, rather than continuing a thought in a stream, but even with the individual thought/ stream, I am not seeing the integration with the preset library And currently it seems clunky.   How do those interact with the streams?  I self identify as a tech person, so I am somewhat embarrassed to even be asking these questions.  And finally, do you anticipate releasing a browser-based desktop version also?   I have been very inspired by your work as look to more fully engage online and grateful to use this tool to help me along this journey.",

In general I agree with that but personally I've also experienced that it can feel extremely good and make you proud of yourself if you manage to push through that stuff on your own. I sometimes had tasks to do that I wish I could delegate to someone else because they seemed overwhelming, would just drain my energy and take lots of time to do. But those tasks were an opportunity to think about how they could be done smarter and more efficient. To find a more systematic way. At the end doing these tasks helped me grow, and invent new techniques. It's a training for your brain, that you cannot get if you just do the things that you enjoy and that come easy to you."

      "Also screens are not the issue, but what\u2019s on them. Yeah ok too much screen time does put too much strain on your eyes and lead to headaches etc, but the things we blame on screens is actually due to what sort of stuff we are consuming, namely a lot of mindless, short content, playing havoc with our attention. If someone spent 18 hours of a day reading a book on their iPad, their eyes would probably feel the strain and we\u2019d probably recommend they read on paper or e-ink, but they may not feel like they\u2019ve wasted their day, depending on the book/other commitments they\u2019re neglecting. So we need to build systems that help us detach from various fast paced streams of information, such as social media or the news",
      "6 hours and 40 minutes? I don\u2019t buy that. Ok yeah let\u2019s not include watching TV on an actual TV let\u2019s say. I\u2019d say a significant majority of people are looking at a desktop or laptop or tablet screen for much of the working day (let\u2019s say 6-8 hours). That\u2019s 6 hours 40 minutes even before using screens outside work is taken into account. Most people use YouTube, Instagram and Tiktok, each I\u2019d say for close to an hour. So we\u2019re up to about 9-11 hours. Plus then texting and other web browsing and I\u2019d reckon we\u2019re looking at more like 11-13 hours. People are on screens during every hour they\u2019re not asleep. Most people sleep about 6-8 hours. So for 16-18 hours of the day people are looking at screens in those hours. By these very rough calculations there are 5 hours without screens. That\u2019s about 80% of the whole day spent on screens. I just don\u2019t know where these stats come from. Anyone else think they\u2019re massively undercooked?",

The video mainly talks about whether you should grow a business or start a youtube channel. The GPS chapter of this video seems pretty interesting, I thought it would be related to , or start talking about how to avoid burnout, but I feel it talks more about what some factors zak should consider to choose to grow a business or youtube channel.",
      "Ali, you\u2019ll never know just how much this video has meant to me. Six months ago, it lit a fire in me. Now, one month into PTYA and 1,000 subscribers in on my new photography-focused channel, I\u2019m generating local leads and building my brand awareness in my local market as a photographer. Your advice helped me prioritize my goals\u2014I even have a money-specific temperature gauge on my wall to track progress. Now, every day, I ask myself: 'Why am I not there already?' That reframe has helped significantly. Can't wait to report back in a year on all the growth.",

Every video is extremely helpful and serves as an essential resource for students ranging from beginner to advanced levels. However, the auto-generated subtitles on YouTube are not always accurate. If you could include proper subtitles in all your videos, it would greatly benefit viewers like me and many others.\n\nThank you for your consideration!"

Also, if you don't always feel like writing in a journal, you can do it on your phone or even record a voice memo talking to yourself. The point is you go through the motions of sitting with your feelings and working through them instead of bottling them up. You'll be surprised with what you can learn about yourself.",
